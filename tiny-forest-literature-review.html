However, there is momentum for implementing green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, wetland detention basins and community gardens, that partially offset these impacts and that benefit human health. GI is often designed to explicitly support ecosystem services, including implied benefits to biodiversity. The effects of GI on biodiversity have been rarely quantified, but research on this topic has increased exponentially in the last decade and a synthesis of the literature is needed. Here, we examined 1,883 published manuscripts and conducted a meta‐analysis on 33 studies that were relevant. We determined whether GI provides additional benefits to biodiversity over conventional infrastructure or natural counterparts. We also highlighted research gaps and identified opportunities to improve future applications. We determined that GI significantly improves biodiversity over conventional infrastructure equivalents, and that in some cases GI had comparable measures of biodiversity to natural counterparts. Many studies were omitted from these analyses because we found GI research has generally neglected conventional experimental design frameworks, including controls, replication or adequate sampling effort. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis identified that taxa specificity is an important consideration for green infrastructure (GI) design relative to the more common measurements at the community level. We also identified that ignoring multi‐trophic interactions and landscape‐level patterns can limit our understanding of GI effects on biodiversity. We recommend further examination of species‐specific differences among infrastructures (i.e. green, conventional or natural equivalents) or using functional traits to improve the efficacy of GI implementation on urban biodiversity. Furthermore, we encourage policy makers and practitioners to improve the design of GI to benefit urban ecosystems because of the potential benefits for both humans and global biodiversity.","Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50 ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.","Abstract: Urban biodiversity is now recognized as playing a critical role in supporting global biodiversity. However, it is important to note that biodiversity is a systematic and holistic concept and prior studies have not generally focused on cross-border or multi-scale management problems. On one hand, the ecosystems of cities are interconnected with adjacent cities by natural landscapes, so they are like mosaics instead of being isolated. Urban biodiversity research demands the consideration of the continuity within an ecosystem. On the other hand, both active protection and passive restoration strategies for urban biodiversity should not only be developed by researchers or municipal government agencies, but more importantly, they should consider the real ecosystem management problems faced by multi-scale departments in order to build a practicable Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model. The solutions for these issues should be included in the analysis to form a complete and more effective urban biodiversity strategy. The study in this paper offers an answer to whether different scales of cities or districts should adopt the same biodiversity strategy; and therefore, the decision depends on whether the places are of the same importance to the global or regional ecosystem, or whether the ecological elements are connected to the adjacent cities/districts and the problems that multiple stakeholders care about.","Background As global biodiversity declines, there’s an increasing need to create an educated and engaged society. Having people from all ages participate in measuring biodiversity where they live helps to create awareness. Recently, the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for biodiversity surveys has gained momentum. Here, we test whether sampling eDNA and metabarcoding can be used for rapid urban biodiversity surveys for educational purposes. Materials &amp; Methods We sampled 2×1 L of water from each of 15 locations in the city of Trondheim, Norway, including a variety of freshwater, marine and brackish habitats. DNA was extracted, amplified in triplicate for the COI gene and sequenced. The obtained data were analysed on the novel mBRAVE platform, an online open access software and computing resource. Results The water samples were collected in two days by two people and the lab analysis was completed in five days by one person. Overall, we detected the presence of 501 taxa identified as belonging to 435 species, representing 90 orders and 18 phyla. On average, only 5.4% of the taxa were shared among six replicates per site. Based on the observed diversity, three distinct clusters were detected and related to geographic distribution of sites. There were some taxa shared between the habitats, with a substantial presence of terrestrial biota. Discussion Our results match expected patterns of biodiversity in the landscape and show that with minimal sampling effort, hundreds of species can be detected. Thus, using eDNA analysis of water is promising for rapid biodiversity surveys, and it is likely that more detailed results could be obtained by optimising field and lab methods for particular groups of interest. We recommend that rapid eDNA surveys, with openly available services and softwares, can be used to raise awareness in the importance of biodiversity.","Green infrastructure (GI) classifications are widely applied to predict and assess its suitability for urban biodiversity and ecosystem service (ES) provisioning. However, there is no consolidated classification, which hampers elucidating synthesis and consolidated relationships across ES and biodiversity. In this research, we aim to bridge the gap between urban GI research on ES and biodiversity by providing a standardized common classification that enables consistent spatial analysis. We analyzed GI classifications used across five ES and four taxa in scientific literature. GI classes were analyzed based on name, definition and characteristics. Results were used to create a novel classification scheme accounting for both ES and biodiversity. We show that many GI classes are unique to a ES or taxon, indicating a lack of multifunctionality of the classification applied. Among the universally used classes, diversity in their definitions is large, reducing our mechanistic understanding of multifunctionality in GI. Finally, we show that most GI classes are solely based on land-use or land-cover, lacking in-depth detail on vegetation. Through standardization and incorporation of key characteristics, we created a consolidated classification. This classification is fully available through openly-accessible databases. Our consolidated standardized classification accommodates interdisciplinary research on ES and biodiversity and allows elucidating urban biodiversity and ES relationships into greater detail, facilitating cross-comparisons and integrated assessments. This will provide a foundation for future research efforts into GI multi-functionality and urban greening policies.","Understanding the development process of urban green space and biodiversity conservation strategies in urban green space is vital for sustainable urban development. However, a systematic review of the urban green space biodiversity research is still lacking. We have retrieved 3806 articles in WOS core journals and carried out the bibliometrics analysis through the three related search terms: urban, green space, and biodiversity. We found that: (1) the year 2009 was a changing point, and the number of articles have increased exponentially since 2009. The United States, China, Europe, and Australia are closely linked, and four research centers have formed; (2) all studies can be classified into three research themes: “Pattern of Urban Green Biodiversity”, “Ecological Function of Urban Green Biodiversity”, and “Sustainability of Urban Green Biodiversity”; (3) based on the evolution of keywords, this field is divided into the budding stage (1998–2012) and the development stage (2012–2021). The keywords in the budding stage focus on the diversity of different species, and the keywords in the development stage focus on the ecosystem services, biodiversity protection, and residents’ satisfaction; (4) the future research focus may be in three aspects: studies on green space in the less urbanized area and urban-rural ecotone, the regulation mechanism and cultural services of urban green space, and the rational layout and management of urban green space. This study hopes to provide a reference for future research on urban green space biodiversity and promote the sustainable development of urban green space.","This paper has the objective to analyze the urban ecology, the biological diversity or biodiversity, and their adaptive cycle as the fundamentals of green economic growth. The analysis begins questioning the implications that some assumptions of urban ecology and biodiversity, such as the socio-ecosystems, resilience, ecosystem services, and adaptive cycle have on the creation of green economic growth. A series of different dimensions of resilience are proposed as subsystems that contribute to the general resilience of a system. The method used is the analytical based on a review of the conceptual and theoretical literature. This analysis concludes that the connectivity of processes and functions of urban ecology and biodiversity are relevant to the creation of green economic growth in terms of green economic value.","Understanding of the ecological impacts of climate change is generally based on long-term average climatic conditions, often average annual temperature or annual total precipitation. There is a growing recognition that the emergence of more frequent and longer-lasting extreme climatic conditions is important in determining changes in biodiversity. I will present recent work from my research group showing that responses of species to environmental changes (both climate change and land-use change) are shaped by exposure to climatic conditions not experienced by these species before the onset of rapid anthropogenic climate change. These results have important implications for understanding future changes in biodiversity, as novel climatic conditions occur more often. number of population cycles throughout a growing season. We use an established population-dynamics model parameterised with temperature-dependent behavioural, physiological and functional response traits, using standardised data from a collated database of values. We use Jensen’s Inequality to incorporate responses to temperature variability. We present results for a range of conceptual temperature scenarios and for future climatic predictions using outputs from the CMIP5 ensemble of global climate models under two emissions scenarios. Western Norwegian fjords are iconic and economically important marine ecosystems that are experiencing climate-related deep-water warming and reduced basin water circulation, leading to deoxygenation and acidification. A new strategic project at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research uses Masfjord, a well-studied fjord ecosystem near Bergen, to examine ecological responses to recent and future climate-related changes. One focal area is on combining analysis of new and existing field observations with numerical model simulations using the NORWECOM.E2E ecosystem model and downscaled climate model projections to examine how climate change may alter the fjord’s carrying capacity and identify changes in deep sea biodiversity and species composition. However, there are challenges to linking ecological datasets with ecosystem and climate models, including differences in scale, species resolution, and temporal resolution. In this presentation, I will share preliminary time-series results and our approach to combining field-based and modelling approaches to examine ecological responses to climate change. Predicting effects of climate change on herbivore population dynamics will require realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics but also herbivore physiology. We used a physiological model of herbivores coupled with a dynamic global vegetation model to predict changes in the population dynamics of Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) in the Eastern Steppe of Mongolia. We simulated population dynamics to 2100 under different climate change scenarios (ISIMIP3b: 5 GCMs, high and low joint SSP/RCP scenarios). Gazelle abundances generally showed large increases that were linked to warmer winter temperatures, which reduced thermoregulation we integrate and through identifying local climatic adaptations and modelling their impacts on future range suitability, range shift potential and population vulnerability to climate change. trap’ – a climatically-driven desynchronisation of the cues that determine life-cycle events and fitness later in the season in a hibernating reptile, the European adder (Vipera berus). Using a mechanistic microclimate model, we derived spring-emergence trends from historical adder observations in Cornwall, UK, and related trends to the likelihood of ground frost exposure. We found that adders advanced their phenology towards earlier emergence and, contradicting the expected effects of macrowarming, that some populations experienced increased exposure to ground frost. The mechanism underpinning this ‘climate trap’ was related to rate at which frost risk diminishes relative to phenological advancement. We emphasise the need to consider exposure to changing microclimatic conditions when forecasting biological impacts of climate change. Vegetation canopy structure, photosynthesis and the global carbon cycle. We report on three years of continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) emissions in two contrasting wetland areas of the Okavango Delta, Botswana: a perennial swamp and a seasonal floodplain. We show that phenology is the overarching control of net CH 4 emissions to the atmosphere in the permanent swamp, and we find that vegetative processes modulate net CH 4 emissions at sub-daily to inter-annual timescales. Both ecosystems were sensitive to drought, which switched these sinks of atmospheric CO 2 into sources due to a weakening of the vegetative sink. CH 4 emissions decreased by a factor of 4 in the seasonal swamp during drought, which had however negligible impact on CH 4 emissions in the perennial swamp. Our study demonstrates that complex and divergent processes coexist within the same landscape, and that meteorological anomalies can significantly perturb the balance of the individual terms of the GHG budget and their respective controls. average global temperature rise between 2040-2060 which then stabilises to 2100, the high emission reaches 1.5-2°C for 2040-2060 and then 3-4°C for 2080-2100. We also examine 2100-2300 given that many ecosystems we are concerned with, such as peatlands and woodlands, persist for decades or centuries. Providing a clear understanding of what we know about climate change in the abstract, and translating this into ecosystem impacts and changes will help us to make better decisions for nature, climate and people. Enabling us to frame what land and sea management needs to look like in the future, and how we manage risks, if biodiversity is to flourish and provide the services we need. Patterns of wetland flooding can act as a strong habitat filter for aquatic communities. Human-induced climate change places constraints on waterbirds by altering the availability of suitable habitat. However, the strength of constraints on waterbird habitat can vary with local climate, regional land use, and water use. Our study investigates the influence of climate variability on waterbird community structure in ancient human-made wetland systems of Central India - situated within the context of the Indian Summer Monsoon. Using satellite-derived climate products and image classification, we present a time-series analysis for the relationship of precipitation, Land Surface Temperature and Evapotranspiration with the timing and duration of wetland flooding. Using 3 seasons of data, we also present the relationship between flooding variables and the probability of use by waterbird communities using an occupancy modeling framework. These results provide a foundational understanding of wetland vulnerability and habitat suitability to inform regional conservation planning. Extreme climate events are projected to become more frequent, and we currently lack a conclusive understanding of how herbaceous plant species will respond to them. We examine the effect of the 2018 European heat wave on the demography of Plantago lanceolata, a short-lived herbaceous perennial. We use demographic data from PlantPopNet, a worldwide spatially distributed data collection effort. We perform a preliminary analysis on a subset of PlantPopNet data which includes European sites that experienced extreme conditions in 2018 and 2019. We link population growth rates and the underlying demographic rates to a drought index: the site-specific standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index. We find that drought negatively impacted the population growth, survival, and biomass growth of P. lanceolata. However, the effects of drought are relatively small, suggesting that short-lived perennial plants like P. lanceolata might be able to persist in the presence of short-term extreme drought events. will forests go: predicting potential future an ancient The study aims to predict the potential future forest cover for Anatolia, a peninsula situated in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, a historic land bridge between Southeast Europe and Southwest Asia with diverse terrestrial ecosystems hosting uniquely adapted species due to topographic heterogeneity and climatic variability. To forecast the potential future distribution of its forests (assuming zero anthropogenic interference), a dynamic regional to global vegetation model, LPJ-GUESS was used, forced with ERA5-Land reanalysis data at 9 km horizontal resolution for the historical simulation (1982 – 2014) and different model contributions to CMIP6 for the future phase (2015-2100) reflecting RCP8.5 scenario. Our preliminary findings show little change to the forest cover for the peninsula for the simulation period, but a significant shift in forest composition in favor of the Mediterranean type pine taxa, indicating a potential future expansion of the Mediterranean type climate within the peninsula, with an increase in risk of forest fires. real an of strong spatial autocorrelation in both species and environmental data. Naturally, projecting such accidental relationships outside the original space-time domain may to completely misleading predictions, whose level of uncertainty will be unknown. This at quantifying the in model predictions related to this by simulating both species and environmental data with known levels of autocorrelation, as well as some on how to deal with the problem in practical modeling. We study wind conditions along the flyways of two Arctic tern populations over the Atlantic Ocean, and assess potential effects of climate change by integrating bird tracking and wind data. The exploitation of favourable winds differs between populations and seasons, with birds either drifting with the general wind patterns (Svalbard population, wind support =s2.47 ± 3.38 m/s), or (partly) compensating for the effect of crosswinds (Netherlands populat","&lt;p&gt;For decades, paleoecological studies in lake sediments have focused on reconstructing the environments of the past and explaining phenomena linked to climatic variations. Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing have allowed access to environmental DNA (eDNA) and ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) as a new and efficient proxy for past and present biodiversity. The basin of Mexico (BM) is located in the central part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt at 2,200 m a.s.l.; with the southern portion harboring the Chalco sub-basin. Lake Chalco is one of the last remaining natural aquatic ecosystems within the ever-expanding urban area surrounding Mexico City. The paleoenvironmental history of this lake has been previously characterized using sedimentological and geochemical proxies, as well as preserved microfossils (diatoms, pollen) with a temporal framework based on multiple radiocarbon dates. However, information for the remaining taxonomic groups and metabolic pathways remained unexplored. Here, we present the first metagenomics-based study for the Holocene in a high-altitude lake in Central Mexico &amp;#8211;Lake Chalco. We explored the relationship between the lake&amp;#8217;s paleoenvironmental condition and estimations of taxonomic and metabolic profiles across the sedimentary sequence (2.5 meters long). Multiple biological and abiotic variables revealed three main environmental phases: 1) a cool freshwater lake (FW1: 11,500-11,000 cal years BP), 2) a warm hyposaline lake (HS2: 11,000-6,000 cal years BP), and 3) a temperate, subsaline lake (SS3, &lt;6,000 cal years BP). We describe the structure of the microbiota community and taxonomy richness turnover in the three Holocene paleoenvironmental phases. During the past 12 000 years BP the most abundant domains in Lake Chalco sediments were Bacteria, followed by Archaea, and Eukarya (36,722 genera). The analysis of functional proteins showed high biodiversity with a total of 27,636,243 proteins identified, but it was only possible to annotate 3,227,398 of them. Also, we identified several genes associated with some relevant pathways, such as methanogenesis. Altogether, this study allowed us to reconstruct the natural history of lake Chalco and its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;","This work intends to analyze the connection between forest remnants of the Brazilian Cerrado biome with Ecological Corridors, aiming at maintaining or increasing Biodiversity in urban centers, considering the development of urban forests and Productive Landscaping as a sustainable alternative for the implementation of multifunctional projects.

These structures are often poor surrogates for natural habitats, and a diversity of eco-engineering approaches have been trialled to enhance their biodiversity, with varying success. \n \n2.We undertook a quantitative meta-analysis and qualitative review of 109 studies to compare the efficacy of common eco-engineering approaches (e.g. increasing texture, crevices, pits, holes, elevations and habitat-forming taxa) in enhancing the biodiversity of key functional groups of organisms, across a variety of habitat settings and spatial scales. \n \n3.All interventions, with one exception, increased the abundance or number of species of one or more of the functional groups considered. Nevertheless, the magnitude of effect varied markedly among groups and habitat settings. In the intertidal, interventions that provided moisture and shade had the greatest effect on the richness of sessile and mobile organisms, while water-retaining features had the greatest effect on the richness of fish. In contrast, in the subtidal, small-scale depressions which provide refuge to new recruits from predators and other environmental stressors such as waves, had higher abundances of sessile organisms while elevated structures had higher numbers and abundances of fish. The taxa that responded most positively to eco-engineering in the intertidal were those whose body size most closely matched the dimensions of the resulting intervention. \n \n4.Synthesis and applications: The efficacy of eco-engineering interventions varies among habitat settings and functional groups. This indicates the importance of developing site-specific approaches that match the target taxa and dominant stressors. Furthermore, because different types of intervention are effective at enhancing different groups of organisms, ideally a range of approaches should be applied simultaneously to maximise niche diversity. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

This paper suggests that in urban settings where landscapes already contain non-natives, both indigenous and exotic flora may be necessary to maintain indigenous biodiversity. The research was constructed based upon a review of the current literature combined with a GIS-based spatial analysis of urban landscape patterns, using Wellington New Zealand as a case study. The research provides evidence concerning different aspects of utilising indigenous and exotic plant species to argue that a balanced proportion of indigenous to exotic plants may be advantageous in order to respond to some aspects of biodiversity loss. The results have three immediate implications for landscape architecture practices at the urban scale and reveal important issues that should be addressed by future research.","Abstract Turkey is a rich country in biodiversity due to its characteristics like topographic and geomorphological structures it shelters, being an extended peninsula and climatic features. Europe and Middle East countries with the richest biodiversity distribution showing the number of plant species in Turkey is close to the number of plant species in the whole of the European continent. According to data of TUBIVES 2017 (official plant database), Turkey owns more than 12000 plant taxa 3000 of which are endemic. Erzurum province shelters 264 of endemic plants growing in East Anatolia, some of which have medicinal and aromatic effects East Anatolia Region of Turkey is the second richest region in the country following the Mediterranean for the number of endemic plant species. The method of research consists of survey, data collection, analysis and synthesis. As a result of this study; among the medicinal and aromatic plants grown naturally in and around Erzurum city, fruit, flowers, calligraphic features, seasonal colour change, plants which can be used as ornamental plants were determined and their usage areas in landscape architecture were determined. _________________________________________________________________________________ Biyocesitlilik ve Kentsel Bahceler: Erzurum (Turkiye) Kentsel Bahcelerinde Kullanilan Tibbi ve Aromatik Bitkiler  Oz Turkiye, sahip oldugu topografik, jeomorfolojik yapi, uc tarafinin denizlerle cevrili olmasi, iklim ozellikleri gibi faktorlerden dolayi biyocesitlilik yonunden oldukca zengin bir ulkedir.  Avrupa ve Orta Dogunun en zengin biyolojik cesitlilige sahip ulkesi olan Turkiye’de yayilis gosteren bitki turlerinin sayisi Avrupa kitasinin tumundeki bitki turlerinin sayisina yakindir.

Field studies of urban vegetation were carried out within the territories of the city of Rostov-on-Don: The Shchepkinsky Forest plantation, the Temernitskaya Grove city grove, the nursery of the Botanical Garden of the Southern Federal University, the park named after. N. Ostrovsky, park them. K. Chukovsky, Ordzhonikidze Park and forest plantation in Aksai. As part of the monitoring, geobotanical descriptions were carried out to assess the species diversity of tree species and subsoil herbaceous vegetation. It has been established that the largest contribution to the composition of the forest park zones of the cities of the South. Rostov-on-Don are introduced by adventive, synanthropic, cultigenic and weed vascular plants. The flora of the agglomeration today remains quite peculiar. Of the seven studied park and recreational zones, the largest floristic composition was noted for «Shchepkinsky Forest» and «Temernitskaya Grove» territories. Even though the Temernitskaya Grove is under anthropogenic pressure, its herbaceous cover is more diverse than in the Shchepkinsky forest. Healthy, weakened and strongly weakened state of the forest stand is noted in all plots. The most identical in systematic composition are very remote groups of park and recreational zones.","For the first time, a mycological analysis of outdoor urban environment (air, leaves, sealed surfaces) was carried in the cities of subarctic (Murmansk) and temperate (Moscow) climatic zones. The chemical composition of dust deposited on leaves of dominant tree species was taken as an indicator of the air quality. Assessment of the complex impact of factors (climate zone, type of substrate, anthropogenic load) on the quantitative and qualitative parameters of mycobiome was performed. Compared to Moscow, Murmansk was characterized by an increased number and concentrations of pollutants in the deposited dust. The number of culturable airborne fungi in Murmansk was substantially lower than in Moscow. Half of the species belonged to the opportunistic in both cities. Most dangerous opportunistic fungi were absent in the air of recreational zones but present on leaves surface and in road dust in all assessed zones of the cities. Dust chemical composition affected the diversity of fungi species. While the relationship of biological parameters with concentration of potentially toxic metals was generally negative, Cd increased the fraction of opportunistic fungi in road dust. The study revealed an importance of substrate in determining the sensitivity of outdoor mycobiome to pollution and highlighted its biological characteristics sensitive to climate.","Urban rivers may perform important ecological roles and provide many ecosystem services, especially in urban contexts. Considering this, River Contracts were officially introduced in 2000, during the Second Forum of the World Water Council, as participative agreements aimed at managing the complexity of fluvial ecosystems. Collecting data on fluvial and riparian biodiversity, establishing ecological relationships among biological components, and evaluating their resistance and resilience to anthropic impacts are needed to assess the ecological sustainability of the anthropic actions. Here, we provide a review of literature and regulation on River Contracts, and a methodological contribution to the evaluation of different environmental components, their ecological connections, and the role of anthropic impacts. To address the aim, we performed a critical analysis of the existing data on the Tiber River close to Rome. We used the information to identify the actions that should be included in the Tiber River Contract to improve its natural value and its potential ecosystem services. Several areas emerged where information was lacking such as the human impact on these ecosystems. Data highlight the disappearance of rare Mediterranean species and of those linked to wetland habitats, as well as an increase in alien species and species typical of disturbed areas. Further research on biodiversity and management is required to support nature conservation.","The concept of a regenerative city goes far beyond a sustainable one. The regenerative approach is to think of urban green space as a productive landscape, a source of food, and a support for biodiversity. In this approach, the so-called urban wastelands have a positive significance. Urban agriculture (UA) has become a commonly discussed topic in recent years with respect to sustainable development. Therefore, the combination of urban fabric and local food production is crucial for ecological reasons. The key issues are the reduction of food miles and the demand for processed food, the production of which strains the natural environment. At the same time, UA enables regeneration and restoration. An original methodological approach was used in the study following the mixed-method research concept: literature survey, case studies, and comparative analysis of objects. A review of UA architecture (UAA) projects was carried out to supplement the knowledge acquired during the bibliometric analysis. In sum, 25 existing projects, including allotment gardens, community gardens, and urban farms in the global north, were compared in this study. As a result of the analyses carried out, the breakdown of urban agriculture was developed into the following categories: (i) architectural–urban, (ii) ecological, (iii) social, and (iv) economic, including the impact of UA on physical activity and social interaction. UA is also a factor shaping the urban landscape. In conclusion, agrarian practice in urban environments has led to the creation of a new type of space, known as UAA. Production in the context of UA exceeds private goods, such as food produced for sale or for individual use. Additional goods include public goods. The review shows that UA fulfills economic, social, and environmental functions, thus falling under the concept of sustainable development.","The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km2 and 12,568,000 km2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km2 more likely.","Natural regeneration is key for large‐scale forest restoration, yet it may lead to different biodiversity outcomes depending on socio‐environmental context. We combined the results of a global meta‐analysis to quantify how biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating forests deviates from biodiversity values in reference old‐growth forests, with structural equation modeling, to identify direct and indirect associations between socioeconomic, biophysical and ecological factors and deviation in biodiversity recovery at a landscape scale. Low deviation within a landscape means higher chances of multiple sites in naturally regenerating forests successfully recovering biodiversity compared to reference forests. Deviation in biodiversity recovery was directly negatively associated with the percentage of cropland, forest cover, and positively associated with the percentage of urban areas in the surrounding landscape. These three factors mediated the indirect associations with rural population size, recent gross deforestation, time since natural regeneration started, mean annual temperature, mean annual water deficit, road density, land opportunity cost, percentage cover of strictly protected forest areas, and human population variation in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that natural forest restoration should be prioritized in landscapes with both low socioeconomic pressures on land use conversion to pasturelands and urban areas, and high percentage of forest cover.","Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016–2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.","Constructed wetlands remove nutrients, contaminants and pollutants from stormwater runoff, while also providing a habitat for wildlife such as macroinvertebrates and fish. Sampling constructed wetlands along a gradient of catchment urbanisation in Melbourne’s west and south east, my overall aim was to determine if increasing catchment imperviousness was related to wetland condition. To address this, I sampled macroinvertebrates to quantify biodiversity, tested fish tissue for heavy metal concentrations to ascertain if bioaccumulation was occurring, used stable isotope analysis to construct food webs, and evaluated ecosystem function using leaf packs to assess rate of decomposition. There was a significant negative relationship between total imperviousness (TI), an indicator of catchment urbanisation, and the abundance of aquatic invertebrates detected for sites in the west, but not in the south east. However, macroinvertebrate communities were relatively homogenous both within and between all study wetlands. Chironomidae (non-biting midges) was the most abundant family recorded at the majority of sites. Chironomids are able to tolerate a wide array of environmental conditions, including eutrophic and anoxic conditions. Their prevalence suggests that water quality is impaired in these systems, regardless of degree of urbanisation, although the causal mechanism is unclear. There was no relationship between TI and water and sediment concentrations of heavy metals with the exception of Zn. Concentrations of metals in fish tissues were highest in benthic species but levels declined with increasing body size and trophic level. Metabolic activity can differ between smaller and larger fish; however, smaller fish may also be feeding on a different food source. My results suggest that metals in these wetlands are not undergoing bioaccumulation. I found that as TI increased, there was a significant decrease in the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates and a significant increase in the values of δ13C and δ15N recorded for fishes and macroinvertebrates. An increase in TI was associated with a decrease in the mean trophic position of fishes and an increase in the mean trophic position of macroinvertebrates. My results suggest that sources of carbon differed between sites of low and high catchment imperviousness. A significant positive relationship existed between TI and rate of leaf litter breakdown in the south eastern wetlands. These results suggest that other parameters besides exposure to contaminants are likely to affect leaf litter breakdown. The overall findings of this study demonstrate that local conditions in wetlands such as morphology and vegetation, have at least as important a role in determining wetland biodiversity and ecosystem function as the degree of urbanisation of the catchment.","Urban development is a leading cause of stream impairment that reduces biodiversity and negatively affects ecosystem processes and habitat. Out‐of‐stream restoration practices, such as stormwater ponds, created wetlands, and restored riparian vegetation, are increasingly implemented as management strategies to mitigate impacts. However, uncertainty exists regarding how effectively they improve downstream ecosystems because monitoring is uncommon and results are typically reported on a case‐by‐case basis. We conducted a meta‐analysis of literature and used response ratios to quantify how downstream ecosystems change in response to watershed development and to out‐of‐stream restoration. Biodiversity in unrestored urban streams was 47% less than that in reference streams, and ecological communities, habitat, and rates of nutrient cycling were negatively affected as well. Mean measures of ecosystem attributes in restored streams were significantly greater than, and 156% of, those in unrestored urban streams. Measures of biodiversity in restored streams were 132% of those in unrestored urban streams, and indices of biotic condition, community structure, and nutrient cycling significantly improved. However, ecosystem attributes and biodiversity at restored sites were significantly less than, and only 60% and 45% of, those in reference streams, respectively. Out‐of‐stream management practices improved ecological conditions in urban streams but still failed to restore reference stream conditions. Despite statistically significant improvements, assessing restoration success remains difficult due to few comparisons to reference sites or to clearly defined targets. These findings can inform future monitoring, management, and development strategies and highlight the need for preventative actions in a watershed context.","Wetlands are a critical part of natural environments that offer a wide range of ecosystem services. In urban areas, wetlands contribute to the livability of cities through improving the water quality, carbon sequestration, providing habitats for wildlife species, reducing the effects of urban heat islands, and creating recreation opportunities. However, maintaining wetlands in urban areas faces many challenges, such as the reduction of hydrological functions, changed water regimes due to barriers, contamination by wastewater, habitat loss due to land-use change, and loss of biodiversity due to the entry of alien species. In this article, we review the theoretical background of wetlands in urban areas through the existing studies in the literature. We provide knowledge on urban wetlands and highlight the benefits of these wetlands in urban areas. These benefits include sustainability, biodiversity, urban heat islands, social perception, and recreation values. We also summarize the objectives, methodologies, and findings of the reviewed articles in five tables. In addition, we summarize the critical research gaps addressed in the reviewed articles. Our review study addresses the research gaps by performing a rigorous analysis to identify significant open research challenges, showing the path toward future research in the field. We further discuss and highlight the role of policymakers and stakeholders in preserving wetlands and finally present our conclusions.","PurposeUrbanization is characterized mainly by changes in land use and conversion of natural areas into built environments, as well as by a series of impacts, such as loss of biodiversity, which interfere with the proper functioning of ecological networks.Design/methodology/approachThus, the authors apply a bibliometric analysis using the term “Urban Trees” in the “Web of Science” database, between 2009 and 2019, as a keyword to include all urban green structures and identify the main aspects of urban ecological relationships. They found 8,367 published articles.FindingsThis review identified the main countries and research institutions that operate in urban afforestation. In general, developing countries seek to understand the environmental benefits that urban afforestation can provide, demonstrating the importance of maintaining existing green areas in urban centers to promote the balance of the ecosystem. It depends directly on the flow of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructures in the city, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration, retention of particulate matter, mitigation of heat islands and reduction of surface runoff, directly favoring the health and well-being of the population. The authors conclude that the actions currently implemented in urban afforestation, especially to increase the richness and abundance of species, will be decisive for the future of urban centers and the construction of more sustainable and egalitarian cities.Originality/valueThis work sought to develop a bibliographic research based on information obtained by bibliometric analysis that has the ability to identify trends and volumes of scientific production in a given area of knowledge.","\nPurpose\nThe Environment Agency estimates that one in six homes in England (approximately 5.2m properties) are at risk from flooding and 185,000 commercial properties are located in flood-prone areas. Further, an estimate of 10,000 new homes are built on flood plains yearly. The UK has witnessed a significant increase in flood events over the past 10 years. During this period, there has been growing research attention into measures to mitigate the effects of flooding, including the benefits of deploying sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDs) in new developments or as a retrofit. The purpose of this paper is to present the development of a cost-benefit analysis model for the retrofit of SuDs focusing on the potential for improved flood risk mitigation in the context of commercial properties.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA synthesis of flood risk management and SuDs literature is used to inform the development of a conceptual cost-benefit analysis model for the retrofit of SuDs and focusing on the potential for improved flood risk mitigation in the context of commercial properties.\n\n\nFindings\nSuDs have been applied successfully in different parts of the world; however, the uptake of SuDs, in particular, the retrofit of SuDs, has been restricted by a number of issues including a lack of experience and trust in their performance and a lack of understanding in their true benefits. In particular, there is the limited experience of retrofitting SuDs and there are no well-established procedures for evaluating the feasibility, value or cost effectiveness of doing this.\n\n\nSocial implications\nThis offers the potential to support the UK government’s flood risk management policy by helping to increase the resilience of properties, whilst offering other benefits to communities such as improvements in air quality and biodiversity and also presenting a clearer understanding of the monetary and non-monetary implication to owners of commercial properties for a more informed and acceptable uptake of SuDs retrofit.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe proposed model will allow a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and associated benefits associated with SuDs retrofit, highlighting the flood risk mitigation benefits that might accrue over a period of time for commercial property.\n","Since the 20th century, the deterioration of the ecological environment around the world has challenged urban space construction. With the development of urbanization, the consumption of resources and energy has increased, the level of biodiversity has decreased, environmental pollution is approaching the critical level, and the contradiction between human habitat activity and ecological environment has become increasingly prominent. The sustainable development of urban space along with its economic and social benefits, taking into account the quality of life and ecological environment, has become a new and important subject that needs to be explored. In this study, the indices of the evaluation system for sustainable urban spatial development in regions with underdeveloped economies but rich in ecological resources are arranged in sequence through the systematic coupling analysis of collaborative evaluation information and a quantitative analysis. The influences of urban space elements on sustainable urban development are disclosed. On the basis of the generated data, an evaluation system for sustainable urban spatial development with a complete set of information is proposed. The proposed system is applicable to urban spatial development evaluation in regions in China with underdeveloped economies but rich in ecological capital. First, the basic concept of system coupling is introduced, and a coupling relationship between urban sustainable development and urban space is proposed. Second, the elements of urban space and the sustainable development in the Qin-Ba mountain area are extracted, and the precedence diagram method is used to construct a sustainable evaluation system for urban space development in the Qin-Ba mountain area. Third, the sustainable evaluation process of urban spatial development is proposed. Finally, the sustainable evaluation system for urban spatial development in the Qin-Ba mountain area is applied to evaluate the urban spatial development in Shangluo, Qin-Ling Mountains, China. The results show that, among the investigated 14 indicators, the proportion of industrial land use mainly influences sustainable urban spatial development. As for the rest of the index factors, per capita green land area and green coverage ratio of built-up areas, per capita urban construction land area, proportion of forestry area, greening rate of built-up areas, total industrial dust emission density, proportion of cultivated area, and average volume fraction of residential areas are the secondary influencing factors of sustainable urban spatial development. The evaluation system in this research is constructed with the three aspects of “green coordination”, “green development”, and “green sustainability” of sustainable urban spatial development, and it complements the evaluation contents of urban–rural ecological space coordination, land resource protection, and green development community, and so on. The conclusion of this study not only can provide a useful reference for urban spatial development planning for underdeveloped ecological capital areas of China but also can provide a theoretical basis for the management and control policy of sustainable urban spatial development.","Author(s): Clarke, Lorraine Weller | Advisor(s): Jenerette, Darrel | Abstract: Urban agricultural systems, like community and home gardens, may act as oases of biodiversity in cities dominated by impervious surfaces. They have also been shown to bridge gaps in food security and provide socio-cultural benefits. Despite these benefits, little research has been conducted that evaluates factors influencing garden plant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Also less intensively researched are ecosystem disservices that gardens can contribute to, like gardener exposure to heavy metals. Urban soil can act as a sink for heavy metal contamination, which is mostly deposited through anthropogenic pollution. This dissertation addresses knowledge gaps about ES with two comprehensive surveys of garden biodiversity and ES production, one on community gardens in Los Angeles (LA), CA and one on home gardens across an urbanizing gradient in Beijing, China. It also addresses disservices and bioavailability of three heavy metals (lead, arsenic, and cadmium) through a soil survey and sequential analysis of heavy metals in LA gardens. My main results indicate an overall shift in biodiversity from provisioning (food and medicinal production) to cultural (ornamental) services with increased gardener income and access to city resources (like grocery stores or markets) in both U.S. and Chinese gardens. This result supports a hierarchy of need, where gardeners preferentially plant species that support their most pressing needs, like food security. Urbanized regions in Beijing and immigrant-run gardens in Los Angeles also formed culturally distinct assemblages of edible species based on shared agricultural experiences. As the most common use for species was food, understanding metal bioavailability is important for accurate risk assessments. Lead, particularly in reducible form, increased the most with age of neighborhood, indicating oxidized lead paint buildup. Cd and As exchangeable fractions increased with proximity to road, indicating sources from air pollution. Finally, while Cd became less bioavailable with increased organic matter, reaction with organic humic acids released reducible As into the bioavailable fraction. These quantitative results can inform land managers about valued biodiversity and provisioning service from gardens in food insecure regions, as well as valuable information on how to predict metal accumulation hotspots and reduce plant uptake of metals.","Imprints of racism Cities create challenging environments for many nonhuman species, and the presence of nonhumans in cities influences the health and well-being of the humans with which they share the environment. Distinct urban conditions are created by landscape modification, but the history of this transformation is not equal across urban environments. Schell et al. review how systematic racist practices such as residential segregation, enacted in part through redlining, have led to an unequal distribution of “nature” within cities. These inequities continue to play out in both the ecological processes of cites and the welfare of their residents. Science, this issue p. eaay4497 BACKGROUND Human activity and decisions drive all life in cities. Worldwide, cities are characterized by extensive anthropogenic transformation of the landscape, modification of biogeochemical processes, and alteration of biological communities. Underlying all of these characteristics of urban ecosystems is an extraordinary variability in human agency, culture, power, and identity. Though our understanding of cities as ecological systems with distinctive community assemblages and landscape features has broadened considerably, researchers still rarely consider the full range of social drivers that affect landscape heterogeneity. One of the most characteristic attributes of cities is social inequality—specifically the uneven distribution of resources and wealth primarily underpinned by structural racism and classism. Because structural inequalities form the foundation of city infrastructure, urban development, governance, management, and landscape heterogeneity, inequality among humans defines the ecological setting and evolutionary trajectories for all urban organisms. More broadly, systematic inequities have profound impacts on global biological change and biodiversity loss. Many emergent social inequity patterns are principally driven by systemic racism and white supremacy. Hence, centering racial and economic justice in urban biological research and conservation is imperative. Here, we show how social inequalities shape ecological and evolutionary processes in U.S. cities and highlight the need for research that integrates justice perspectives with ecological and evolutionary dynamics. ADVANCES Although a rich literature demonstrates how historical and contemporary inequities emerge and persist in human systems, a transdisciplinary perspective that integrates social and cultural processes into an urban eco-evolutionary framework remains unexplored. In today’s world, humans often shape the ecological conditions that drive patterns of species distribution and evolution. Distinctive urban landscape features—including reduced habitat patch size, novel plant communities, and increased distance among similar patches—affect key ecological processes such as population dynamics, species interactions, and food web structure. Recent research emphasizes that socioeconomic and demographic factors predict within-city variation in diverse environmental conditions. Humans directly control urban plant, animal, and microbe communities. Further, decisions about urban resource management are often dictated by a subset of individuals and institutions with social or economic capital. These decisions can bias the distribution of societal benefits derived from nature. Dominant social groups also enact and enforce policies and societal norms that exacerbate social and environmental inequities. Wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods generally have more green space, more trees, and greater plant diversity than less affluent neighborhoods. In addition, synergies among pollution (e.g., light, noise, chemical), resource distribution, subsidized predators, and non-native species present novel challenges to organisms, which must respond by moving elsewhere, acclimatizing, adapting, or facing local extirpation. These stressors are often stratified according to racial and/or ethnic backgrounds and wealth. Further, intraspecific variation in phenotypic and genotypic traits of urban species may reflect human-induced disturbances. These relationships highlight the potential for both adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes in urban subpopulations to vary across neighborhoods within cities. OUTLOOK Stratification of wealth and property ownership shapes the distribution and management of urban spaces, thus constructing the urban ecosystem. Systemic racism and classism drive urban wealth stratification, emphasizing the need to address inequality-driven environmental heterogeneity in urban ecological and evolutionary studies. Residential segregation and colonial annexation (as well as gentrification and displacement) generate predictable ecological patterns in vegetation, air and water quality, microclimate, soils, and the built environment through the rapid influx of resources to specific areas. Accounting for such processes will allow more accurate estimation of the effect of humans on urban organisms. Deconstructing the complex and nuanced attributes of social inequality in affecting biological phenomena can also inform more equitable and sustainable urban planning solutions that implement anti-racist and justice-centered actions. Racial oppression and economic injustice are jeopardizing urban and global ecosystem health and function. Structural racism and classism are further layered with other inequalities, thus necessitating an intersectional approach to urban ecology. Deeper integration across the natural and social sciences is therefore an urgent priority for advancing our understanding of urban ecosystems and developing applied solutions that promote environmental justice, equity, and sustainability. Residential segregation and systemic racism have substantial impacts on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in cities. Government-sponsored policies stratify neighborhoods on the basis of race and class (e.g., through “redlining” in the United States, represented here by the red circle), which results in restricted access to social services and environmental amenities for racial and/or ethnic minorities and low-income communities (red arrows). Habitat quantity and quality tend to be greater in wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods (green arrows), which leads to variations in ecological and evolutionary processes, underscoring the influence of systemic racism and inequality in driving urban landscape characteristics. Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities—specifically racism—and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization’s biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.","There is an urgent need to thoroughly review and comprehend the effects of urbanization on wildlife in order to understand both the ecological implications of increasing urbanization and how to mitigate its threat to biodiversity globally. We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world.","Urbanization is a severe threat to global biodiversity, often leading to taxonomic and functional homogenization. However, current urban ecology research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i) understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies. In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition. Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83%. Our analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular types of species.","Green roofs are important green spaces in order to improve vegetated area in urban landscapes. They can support ecosystem functionality, including stormwater management, cooling and insulation of buildings, moderation of urban heat island effect, contribution to human health and habitat provisioning. In addition they provide habitats in areas deprived of natural wildlife areas, providing green corridors linking fragmented existing habitats, improve wildlife movement and dispersal, thereby increasing population connectivity and act as refuges for declining or rare species. Unfortunately populations living in urban areas continue to rise and are expected to reach 61% in 2030, which is likely to negatively impact urban green spaces. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. Additionally, feasibility analysis of the planting project of possible extensive green roof application in semi-arid climatic conditions of Cyprus was carried out. Positive effects of the plants on the roof are also discussed. Feasibility analysis was carried out for the NEU car factory management building which was planned as 820 m 2 . The following plant species have been suggested for the vegetation of sustainable green roof system in Cyprus; Sedum angelina , Sedum spurium , Sedum glaucophyllum, Thymus vulgaris , Santolina spp., Gaura lindheimeri , Lavandula angustifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis. According to research results 820 m 2 of extensive green roof will cost approximately 37107 Euro. Under Cyprus climatic conditions, this cost analysis estimated that extensive green roof application would cost around 49 Euro per square meter. This research provides valuable information for the importance of green roof establishments within the Mediterranean cityscapes and also has suggestions of vegetation types and roof layers for future green roof projects for the Mediterranean region.","Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta‐analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban–suburban, suburban–rural and suburban–natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban–suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban–rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban–suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.","Resilience is an increasingly important urban policy discourse that has been taken up at a rapid pace. Yet there is an apparent gap between the advocacy of social-ecological resilience in scientific literature and its take-up in policy discourse on the one hand, and the demonstrated capacity to govern for resilience in practice on the other. This paper explores this gap by developing a performative account of how social-ecological resilience is dealt with in practice through case study analysis of how protection of biodiversity was negotiated in response to Melbourne’s recent metropolitan planning initiative. It is suggested that a performative account expands the possible opportunities for governing for social-ecological resilience beyond the concept’s use as a metaphor, measurement, cognitive frame or programmatic statement of adaptive management/co-management and has the potential to emerge through what has been called the everyday ‘mangle of practice’ in response to social-ecological feedback inherent to policy processes.","Abstract Protecting coastal communities has become increasingly important as their populations grow, resulting in increased demand for engineered shore protection and hardening of over 50% of many urban shorelines. Shoreline hardening is recognized to reduce ecosystem services that coastal populations rely on, but the amount of hardened coastline continues to grow in many ecologically important coastal regions. Therefore, to inform future management decisions, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the ecosystem services of biodiversity (richness or diversity) and habitat provisioning (organism abundance) along shorelines with versus without engineered-shore structures. Seawalls supported 23% lower biodiversity and 45% fewer organisms than natural shorelines. In contrast, biodiversity and abundance supported by riprap or breakwater shorelines were not different from natural shorelines; however, effect sizes were highly heterogeneous across organism groups and studies. As coastal development increases, the type and location of shoreline hardening could greatly affect the habitat value and functioning of nearshore ecosystems.","Outdoor stoneworks sustain biofilm formation and are constantly at risk of deterioration by micro‐organisms. In this study, the biofilm microflora of historic limestone tombstones located in a highly polluted urban environment (Cambridge, MA) and in a less polluted location (Lexington, MA) were compared using comprehensive RNA‐based molecular analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences as well as sequences of genes for different pathways of sulphur metabolism (soxB, apsA, dsrA). The metabolically active micro‐organisms detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA fragments were predominantly represented by cyanobacteria (belonging to the family Nostocaceae and to the genus Chroococcidiopsis) in both polluted and unpolluted environments. The investigation of soxB, apsA, dsrA transcripts reflected the abundance and the diversity of sulphur‐oxidizing and sulphate‐reducing bacteria in the Cambridge samples in comparison with the Lexington samples. The investigation revealed that in addition to phototrophic sulphur bacteria belonging to the genera Thiocapsa, Halochromatium, Allochromatium, Thiococcus and Thermochromatium, other sulphate‐oxidizing prokaryotes (e.g. the genus Thiobacillus) as well as sequences of Deltaproteobacteria from the genus Desulfovibrio occurred at the polluted urban site. The interactions between the main functional groups retrieved from the limestone tombstones were discussed.","Urbanization results in the systemic conversion of land-use, driving habitat and biodiversity loss. The “urban convergence hypothesis” posits that urbanization represents a merging of habitat characteristics, in turn driving physiological and functional responses within the biotic community. To test this hypothesis, we sampled five cities (Baltimore, MD, United States; Helsinki and Lahti, Finland; Budapest, Hungary; Potchefstroom, South Africa) across four different biomes. Within each city, we sampled four land-use categories that represented a gradient of increasing disturbance and management (from least intervention to highest disturbance: reference, remnant, turf/lawn, and ruderal). Previously, we used amplicon sequencing that targeted bacteria/archaea (16S rRNA) and fungi (ITS) and reported convergence in the archaeal community. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing and QPCR of functional genes to the same soil DNA extracts to test convergence in microbial function. Our results suggest that urban land-use drives changes in gene abundance related to both the soil N and C metabolism. Our updated analysis found taxonomic convergence in both the archaeal and bacterial community (16S amplicon data). Convergence of the archaea was driven by increased abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea and genes for ammonia oxidation (QPCR and shotgun metagenomics). The proliferation of ammonia-oxidizers under turf and ruderal land-use likely also contributes to the previously documented convergence of soil mineral N pools. We also found a higher relative abundance of methanogens (amplicon sequencing), a higher relative abundance of gene sequences putatively identified as Ni-Fe hydrogenase and nickel uptake (shotgun metagenomics) under urban land-use; and a convergence of gene sequences putatively identified as contributing to the nickel transport function under urban turf sites. High levels of disturbance lead to a higher relative abundance of gene sequences putatively identified as multiple antibiotic resistance protein marA and multidrug efflux pump mexD, but did not lead to an overall convergence in antibiotic resistance gene sequences.","In this data paper, we describe environmental DNA (eDNA) cytochrome c oxidase (COI) amplicon sequence data from New York City’s Bronx River Estuary. As urban systems continue to expand, describing and monitoring their biodiversity is increasingly important for sustainability. Once polluted and overexploited, New York City’s Bronx River Estuary is undergoing revitalization and restoration. To investigate and characterize the area’s diversity, we collected and sequenced river sediment and surface water samples from Hunts Point Riverside and Soundview Parks (ntotal = 48; nsediment = 25; nwater = 23). COI analysis using universal primers mlCOIintF and jgHCO2198 detected 27,328 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) from 7,653,541 sequences, and rarefaction curves reached asymptotes indicating sufficient sampling depth. Of these, eukaryotes represented 9,841ASVs from 3,562,254 sequences. At the study sites over the sampling period, community composition varied by substrate (river sediment versus surface water) and with water temperature, but not pH. The three most common phyla were Bacillariophyta (diatoms), Annelida (segmented worms), and Ochrophyta (e.g. brown and golden algae). Of the eukaryotic ASVs, we identified 614 (6.2%) to species level, including several dinoflagellates linked to Harmful Algal Blooms such as Heterocapsa spp., as well as the invasive amphipod Grandidierella japonica. The analysis detected common bivalves including blue (Mytilus edulis) and ribbed (Geukensia demissa) mussels, as well as soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), in addition to Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) that are being reintroduced to the area. Fish species undergoing restoration such as river herring (Alosa pseudoharengus, A. aestivalis) failed to be identified, although relatively common fish including Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia), menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) were found. The data highlight the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for analyzing urban estuarine biodiversity and provide a baseline for future work in the area.","Human population continues to aggregate in urban centers. This inevitably increases the urban footprint with significant consequences for biodiversity, climate, and environmental resources. Urban growth prediction models have been extensively studied with the overarching goal to assist in sustainable management of urban centers. Despite the extensive body of research, these models are not frequently included in the decision making process. This review aims on bringing this gap by analyzing results from a survey investigating developer and user perceptions from the modeling and planning communities, respectively. An overview of existing models, including advantages and limitations, is also provided. A total of 156 manuscripts is identified. Analysis of aggregated statistics indicates that cellular automata are the prevailing modeling technique, present in the majority of published works. There is also a strong preference for local or regional studies, a choice possibly related to data availability. The survey found a strong recognition of the models’ potential in decision making, but also limited agreement that these models actually reach that potential in practice. Collaboration between planning and modeling communities is deemed essential for transitioning models into practice. Data availability is considered a stronger restraining factor by respondents with limited algorithmic experience, which may indicate that model input data are becoming more specialized, thus significantly limiting wide-spread applicability. This review assesses developer and user perceptions and critically discusses existing urban growth prediction models, acting as a reference for future model development. Specific guidelines are provided to facilitate transition of this relatively mature science into decision making activities","Abstract Suitability evaluation for land is a complex task due to tensions between the need to develop residential and industrial areas and the wish to preserve high biodiversity and heterogeneous landscapes. We proposed an integrated method for land suitability evaluation (LSE) based on geographic information systems (GIS) under uncertainty. The method of grey relational analysis (GRA) was incorporated into analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to address the uncertainty during the process of evaluation. The systematic evaluation approach was tested by using urban expansion land in Changsha City as a case study. Based on the land–environmental information system database, the evaluation indicator system was established, which consisted of three subsystems criteria (biological and water resources, soil resource, and society and economy) and eight factors. Results show that the sum of highly suitable, moderately suitable, and marginally suitable land covers an area of 6,561.27 km2, 55.48% of the total land area...","The study of ecosystem services (ES) is becoming increasingly popular, as it plays an important role in human wellbeing, economic growth, and livelihoods. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the global trend in ES research using a rigorous systematic review of highly cited articles. The articles for this study were extracted from Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) covering the period from 2000 to 2020. This study was limited to SCI-E, ESCI, and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The term “ecosystem service/s” has been used as a research term to filter the study sample and eliminate other databases from the analysis. A citation level equal to or greater than 200 was used to further filtration of articles. This query could restrict to 128 articles that are highly cited in the selected period. Bibliometric analysis results show that, according to the author’s keywords, the “ecosystem service/s” keyword is highly connected to the “biodiversity”, “valuation”, “marine spatial planning”, and “conservation planning”. The U.S.A., Canada, China, France, and Australia are the leading countries in the cumulative number of highly cited articles and networks of co-authors. The U.S.A. is a strong contributor to ES research with China, Canada, and France. The most productive universities linked to the United States were the University of Minnesota, the University of California-Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara), and the Chinese Academy of Science. The most significant and compelling author is Halpern S Benjamin, who represents UC Santa Barbara. He has earned international recognition for a model he developed to analyze global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change in marine environments. The most accessed and studied fields in the ES are terrestrial, urban, and marine environments.","Humanity is altering natural systems, removing habitat, causing extinctions and altering of natural cycles. This era is so dominated by anthropogenic processes that has come to known as the ‘Anthropocene’. Coastal and marine ecosystems are among the many systems experiencing degradation, due to continuous resource consumption and waste disposal that feature prominently within environmental agendas. These changes are occurring against a backdrop of climate change. The effects of climate change are already apparent in marine systems at local and global scales. Coastal ecosystems are in close proximity to human developments and deliver a range of important ecosystem services that support human well-being (e.g. global fisheries, sea defences, and regulates nutrient cycling and the climate). With 44% of the world’s population living within 100 km of the coast, human activities are very likely to influence the functioning of coastal ecosystems that underpin these ecosystem services. This thesis provides insights on the biodiversity of a very wide spread coastal ecosystem: mudflats. \nThe macrofaunal assemblages inhabiting mudflats are globally and regionally important and mediate a number of ecological functions e.g. secondary production, nutrient and carbon cycling, and the creation of biogenic habitat. The biological traits of macrofauna are defined as the morphological, physiological and behavioural attributes of an organism that interact with the environment and as such they can describe the potential of an organism to contribute to these functional roles. This thesis aims to understand the biodiversity of macrofaunal assemblages inhabiting subtropical mudflats, differences in species composition on the functioning, functional redundancy and the resilience of mudflat functions in the presence of increasing human activities and climate change impacts. \nMudflats are widespread but are subjected to continuous alterations by human activities. In chapter 2, a systematic database search (WoS and SCOPUS) was conducted to identify published literature focusing on mudflat macrofaunal assemblages. The searches produced 277 papers addressing benthic macrofaunal assemblages and more than 50% of the published literature were from temperate regions, 33% from the subtropics, 10% from tropical mudflats and data from polar systems were rare. Of the 277 papers, only 68 papers contained sufficient methodological detail and original data and so were deemed relevant for inclusion in the analysis. In total 163 datasets on macrofaunal assemblages were extracted for the analysis including 448 taxa from 4 climatic zones and 10 biogeographic region. In the lower latitudes (tropical), traits such as smaller body sizes, shorter life spans and taxa that have exoskeletons were abundant while direct developmental modes are more prevalent at high latitudes (temperate). Despite these differences, the degree of similarity in biological trait composition of macrofaunal assemblages was higher relative to the taxonomic composition across both climatic and biogeographic spatial scales. This suggest that mudflats globally deliver similar functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling, secondary production etc. The functional redundancy observed across regional and climatic boundaries suggest that ecosystem functioning and service delivery may be expected to show some resilience to perturbations. However, increased human activities may continue to pose a threat to mudflat functioning. \nSubtropical mudflats support a diverse macrofaunal assemblage consisting of a mixture of tropical and temperate species. Chapter 3 presents the most spatially and taxonomically comprehensive study to date of intertidal mudflat macrofauna along the SE Queensland coast. The effects of climate change were apparent among the studied macrofaunal assemblages. The results presented in chapter 3 showed that for the 24 mudflats sampled in SE Queensland, eight species have moved 146 km distance southwards since 1950s. The species substitutions (arrival of tropical range shifters) observed to date, do not appear to have altered the ecological functioning of these mudflats significantly, as indexed by biological trait composition, with ecosystem service delivery being maintained through functional redundancy. However, simple models of further species turnover suggest that the limits of this ‘buffer’ may soon be exceeded with consequences for a range of ecosystem services. \nThe World’s coastlines have become heavily modified over the last century, and the biodiversity and health of adjacent natural intertidal habitats have declined under increasing pressure from urbanisation. Similarly, the coastal urbanization activities in SE Queensland regions have shown an effect on the macrobenthic assemblages because the species composition of sub-catchments containing 4-12% industrial activity differed significantly from the species composition observed in sub-catchments with 53-90% residential coverage and sub-catchments with a mix (54-70%) of nature reserves and low intensity urban/rural activities. However, we did not observe a clear impact of urbanisation in structuring macrofaunal assemblages. It is likely that the impacts of urbanisation will vary depending on the nature of industry, rather than ‘urbanisation’ as a whole. Although changes in species composition were observed at varying degrees of urbanisation, the trait composition of the macrofaunal assemblages did not vary between the four sub-catchment land uses suggesting conservation in functioning and ecological redundancy in subtropical mudflat ecosystems. \nThe manipulation of biological traits in experimental studies is an important tool for understanding changes in ecological functioning under anthropogenic pressure, and exploring the relationships between biodiversity and functioning. In Chapter 5 I have experimentally investigated how the density manipulation of two common large taxa Macrophthalmus setosus (Ms) (sentinel crab) and Pyrazus ebeninus (Pe) (Hercules mudwhelk), that exhibit functionally distinct traits would influence the ecological assemblage and its functioning, e.g. the primary productivity, sediment oxygenation, carbon cycling and nutrient cycling. Theoretical biodiversity ecosystem functioning (BEF) models were used to explain the biodiversity functioning relationships observed in subtropical mudflats. A change in the species and trait composition of the resident macrofaunal assemblage was apparent when the densities of P. ebeninus was increased. The BEF models did show a degree of redundancy for some ecological functions (e.g. sediment oxygenation, carbon cycling and nutrient cycling) suggesting that initially subtropical mudflats may show some resilience to environmental perturbations.","Constructed Stormwater Management Systems (CSMSs) are usually designed to treat urban runoff, but can act as artificial habitats that support relatively diverse aquatic ecosystems. However, in order to manage these systems in an environmentally friendly way, more knowledge of the factors affecting the biodiversity within these CSMSs is required. The aim of this thesis was to deduce the main factors that affect the biodiversity within CSMSs. The report is split into two main sections: the first part consisting of a literature review and the second containing data analysis. Following the literature review, the factors that appeared to have the greatest impact on the biodiversity within CSMSs were: salinity; pond size and shape; vegetation; nitrogen oxide concentrations; noise; and PAHs and heavy metal concentrations. However, it is apparent that nature is a complex system, with many of these factors interlinked and interrelated; therefore, no factors should be neglected. Furthermore, different species have various tolerance and lethal concentration levels for each harmful factor. Following the data analysis, it became clear that pond age and CSMSs substrate type also have a statistically significant effect on the biodiversity within CSMSs. Pond age may form a polynomial relationship, with biodiversity increasing in the short-term, peaking and then decreasing in the long-term when heavy metal accumulations become lethal. Clay (naturally) based ponds seem to support the highest biodiversity, with PEHD bases slightly negatively correlated and concrete bases very negatively correlated with biodiversity. Future design and management of CSMSs should consider the potential aquatic habitats that these systems have to offer, as well as being primarily designed to limit pollution to the wider environment. To increase the regional biodiversity, the design of CSMSs should be personalised, at a family level, to satisfy the different needs of Fish, Amphibians and Invertebrates, and to move away from homogeneity and towards heterogeneity.","Quantifying hunting-induced defaunation As the human population grows and increasingly encroaches on remaining wildlife habitat, hunting threatens many species. Benítez-López et al. conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of hunting trends and impacts across the tropics (see the Perspective by Brashares and Gaynor). Bird and mammal populations were considerably lower in areas where hunting occurred. Although commercial hunting and proximity to roads and urban centers were the most damaging factors, all hunting had worrying impacts, even in protected areas. Protection and alternative approaches for sustainable subsistence hunting must be implemented soon if we are to prevent further, rapid defaunation. Science, this issue p. 180; see also p. 136 Hunting of wildlife significantly affects mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Hunting is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters’ access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.","Author(s): Montenegro, Maywa | Advisor(s): Iles, Alastair | Abstract: Seeds are central to agrobiodiversity, and farmers have historically bred a rich array of crop seeds to sustain rural and urban communities. Over the past 150 years, however, trajectories in macroeconomic development, science and research, and agricultural policy have dovetailed with environmental changes to diminish seed diversity and the living agricultures it supports. While genetic erosion has emerged as a global challenge, access to that diversity has also come into stark relief: Industry consolidation, the development of transgenic crops, and intellectual property rights are now seen as constraints on free exchange of seeds and the ability of farmers and breeders to adapt and breed resilient crop cultivars. How can seed diversity – and access to it – be expanded once more?To address this question, my dissertation develops a ‘political ecology of seeds.’ Building on the foundational account of seed primitive accumulation by Kloppenburg (1988), I examine several dimensions left underexplored in this and other accounts: new, countervailing forces of repossession working against primitive accumulation; the knowledge politics of seed production and of seed science; and the co-production of institutions, policies, discourse, and knowledge together. Using a constructivist theoretical framework, my project explores how knowledge politics and coproduction are instrumental in carving out new – and retracing old – territories for seed enclosures in the contemporary era. By examining how often-invisible discourses and practices underpin seed dispossession, we are better equipped to organize alternatives – not only to reject colonial and capitalist habits of thought/practice, but to revitalize communal, ethical, and economic strategies of repossession. My thesis includes three core papers, alongside introduction, theory, and conclusion chapters. In the first paper, I critically interrogate meanings of ‘diversity’ via rivaling discourses of seed ‘loss’ and ‘persistence’ visible in the scientific, international policy, and farmer movement literatures over 40-plus years. On one hand, numerous studies and stories indicate that crop genetic diversity is rapidly eroding worldwide. On the other hand, much data suggests that far from disappearing, seed diversity persists – resisting homogenizing trends within industrial capitalism. Yet in lieu of binary analyses, a more accurate accounting, I argue, can come from investigating the epistemic practices and politics of agrobiodiversity: what is known – recognized, measured, valued – as being lost or maintained. Evaluating historical data on farmer naming systems along with newer methods of genomic and biochemical analysis, I develop a multi-dimensional framework for understanding seed diversity.My second paper considers crop wild relatives (CWR) as a fast-emerging site for new seed primitive accumulation. Faced with imminent climate change, scientists and agribusinesses are vying to develop crops that can survive drought, floods, and shifting pest regimes. CWR offer breeders the allure of ‘climate-hardy traits,’ infusing genomes of modern crops with ‘lost’ genetic variety. Paradoxically, wild relatives themselves are endangered, propelling CWR into the limelight as an international conservation and food-security priority. I examine accumulation processes along two fronts: conservation policies, where in situ approaches, typically regarded as empowering alternatives to ex situ, instead may support appropriation; and breeding and biotechnology research, which produces new use values for CWR while profoundly shaping upstream conservation priorities.My third and final paper explores the US-based Open Source Seed Initiative as one example of repossession. OSSI has created an alternative to intellectual property rights with a ‘protected commons’ for seed. Commons scholarship has contributed much on theories of institutional governance. But, I argue, attending to the practice of ‘commoning’ helps illuminate a more complex triad: communities who manage shared resources according to negotiated social protocols. Employing the metaphor of ‘beating the bounds’ – a feudal practice of contesting enclosures – I ask how OSSI defends the commons in intersecting arenas. First is legal, as OSSI negotiates a move from contract law toward moral economy law. Next is epistemic, as a ‘freelance’ breeder network revitalizes informal farmer-breeder knowledge, proving less structurally constrained than formal university breeders to lead commoning efforts. Third is seed sovereignty, as OSSI engages with global South movements whose diverse cosmovisions and seed cultures pose new challenges for constructing transnational commons. I conclude by using spatial ‘centricity’ to conceptualize power relations in seed systems. CWR exemplifies ‘ex-situ centric’ flows of seed knowledge, power, and value away from local communities to centralized, often distant sites of recognizing and classifying diversity. Expertise is conferred primarily upon those scientists and industrialists who can produce commodity goods. By contrast, OSSI mobilizes breeder and farmer knowledge in a countervailing, ‘in-situ centric’ direction: towards local spaces, towards legitimizing farmer-breeders as knowledge makers. This movement, I conclude, is not merely an opposite force: it triangulates across three bases of ‘emancipatory’ action at the heart of agroecology, food sovereignty and commoning. Uniting politics of recognition (race, gender, identity), politics of redistribution (class and inequality), and politics of representation (democracy and citizenship), the question of seed diversity and access, I suggest, is ultimately a political one. It calls for recognizing diverse knowledge-makers, redistributing genetic resources as commons, de-centralizing seed reproduction to suit heterogenous agroecologies, and addressing base inequalities in power that drive dispossession.","Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) can inform adaptation policy and help in incorporating climate futures in planning. The literature on CCVA stems from a number of research paradigms (e.g., risk assessment, natural disaster management, and urban planning), therefore making it difficult to extract major directions and methodologies from this body of work. A large number of assessments are based, partly or totally, on indicators which bring up specific methodological problems and constraints. In this study, first, we discuss the most important methodological challenges facing indicator‐based vulnerability assessment (IBVA) based on a set of key conceptual papers in the field. Second, we conduct a meta‐analysis of a representative sample of peer‐reviewed IBVA studies, to identify how current research on IBVA is engaging with these challenges. We attempt to elicit major thematic and methodological trends in this corpus with specific focus on issues related to geographical and temporal scales, aggregation, and nonlinearity. We find that health of ecosystems and biodiversity (28%), freshwater quantity and quality (12%), and public health (10%) have attracted the highest number of studies. Less than a third of the papers in our sample give some consideration to uncertainty and nonlinearity. Assessments typically use aggregation methods that are based on the Multiple Attribute Utility Theory despite the fact that IBVA rarely satisfies the theoretical requirements of this approach. A small percentage of IBVA studies critically scrutinize prevalent assessment methodologies or attempt to develop new ones, despite the raised questions in key theoretical papers about its methodological aspects.

However, much of New York City’s biodiversity remains undescribed, including in the historically degraded, but recovering Bronx River Estuary. In a pilot study to identify organisms and characterise biodiversity patterns there, 18S rRNA gene amplicons (V1–V3 region), obtained from river sediments and surface waters of Hunts Point Riverside and Soundview Parks, were sequenced. Across 48 environmental samples collected over three seasons in 2015 and 2016, following quality control and contaminant removal, 2,763 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were identified from 1,918,463 sequences. Rarefaction analysis showed sufficient sampling depth, and community composition varied over time and by substrate at the study sites over the sampling period. Protists, plants, fungi and animals, including organisms of management concern, such as Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), wildlife pathogens and groups related to Harmful Algal Blooms, were detected. The most common taxa identified in river sediments were annelid worms, nematodes and diatoms. In the water column, the most commonly observed organisms were diatoms, algae of the phylum Cryptophyceae, ciliates and dinoflagellates. The presented dataset demonstrates the reach of 18S rRNA metabarcoding for characterising biodiversity in an urban estuary.","Abstract Background Riverine ecosystems are biogeochemical powerhouses driven largely by microbial communities that inhabit water columns and sediments. Because rivers are used extensively for anthropogenic purposes (drinking water, recreation, agriculture, and industry), it is essential to understand how these activities affect the composition of river microbial consortia. Recent studies have shown that river metagenomes vary considerably, suggesting that microbial community data should be included in broad-scale river ecosystem models. But such ecogenomic studies have not been applied on a broad “aquascape” scale, and few if any have applied the newest nanopore technology. Results We investigated the metagenomes of 11 rivers across 3 continents using MinION nanopore sequencing, a portable platform that could be useful for future global river monitoring. Up to 10 Gb of data per run were generated with average read lengths of 3.4 kb. Diversity and diagnosis of river function potential was accomplished with 0.5–1.0 ⋅ 106 long reads. Our observations for 7 of the 11 rivers conformed to other river-omic findings, and we exposed previously unrecognized microbial biodiversity in the other 4 rivers. Conclusions Deeper understanding that emerged is that river microbial consortia and the ecological functions they fulfil did not align with geographic location but instead implicated ecological responses of microbes to urban and other anthropogenic effects, and that changes in taxa manifested over a very short geographic space.","Rapid urban expansion has profoundly impacted on urban biodiversity,ecosystem functions,regional climate change,and the quality of life.One of the ecological consequences of urban expansion is the Urban Heat Island(UHI) phenomenon,which is formed when higher atmospheric and surface temperatures in urbanized areas are observed over the surrounding rural area.Urban thermal environment problems caused by UHI have some further impacts on energy consumption,human health and urban sustainable development.As a synthesis representation of urban environment effect,UHI is jointly determined by the physical properties of land surface and heat release by related socioeconomic activities.Within the urbanized area there are diverse landscape types,such as urban building landscape,road landscape,green space,water body,and so on.Among various urban landscape types,the thermal environment effect of water landscape is quite different.It is important to study how the water body might influence the urban thermal environment.The SPOT 5 and Landsat 7 ETM+ images are applied to derive the spatial pattern of urban water landscape and land surface temperature in Shanghai,and spatial analysis technique will be used to explore the thermal environment effect of water landscape.An intense urban heat island effect is identified in Shanghai City,with its center located on the west bank of Huangpu River.At the same time,a cold island effect is detected for the water landscape patches and corridors.Statistical significance is not found between area and perimeter of water patches(or river corridors) and their impact on local thermal environment.However,the water patch has a stronger thermal environment effect than the river corridor.The impact of water patch decreases as the distance to UHI center increases.For instance,the temperature of water patch in Luxun Park(the closest to the UHI center among all water patches) is 3.65℃ lower than the average temperature of its surrounding region,with only 2.60℃ lower than the average temperature of the region where Century Park is located,which is much further to the UHI center.Besides the distance to the UHI center,the impact of water patch on nearby area is also determined by the land surface composition.For instance,the surrounding area with more vegetation has a lower temperature than the area with more impervious surface.River corridors also influence the local thermal environment.Huangpu River,Suzhou River,Yunzao River and Chuanyang River are compared based on a buffering method,with the river width and the location of the river corridor as the two key factors on the local thermal environment.Flowing through UHI center and with the largest river width,Huangpu River has much higher impact on the thermal environment of the surrounding areas.The findings in this study are helpful to provide some effective policy implications for urban planning and design.","Significance Bacterial natural products (NPs) have served as inspiration for many therapeutics. The hunt for new bioactive NPs has led to a global search for natural ecosystems from which bacteria can be cultured. Here, we used NP-focused metagenome sequencing to explore biosynthetic diversity in urban park soil of New York City. Our analyses reveal rich biosynthetic diversity in these microbiomes and predict that gene clusters encoding many clinically approved NPs families discovered using bacteria cultured from around the world are actually present in the soil microbiomes of a single city. Contrary to traditional NP discovery efforts that involve shallow explorations of diverse environments, our data suggest that a deeper exploration of local microbiomes may prove equally, if not, more productive. Numerous therapeutically relevant small molecules have been identified from the screening of natural products (NPs) produced by environmental bacteria. These discovery efforts have principally focused on culturing bacteria from natural environments rich in biodiversity. We sought to assess the biosynthetic capacity of urban soil environments using a phylogenetic analysis of conserved NP biosynthetic genes amplified directly from DNA isolated from New York City park soils. By sequencing genes involved in the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and polyketides, we found that urban park soil microbiomes are both rich in biosynthetic diversity and distinct from nonurban samples in their biosynthetic gene composition. A comparison of sequences derived from New York City parks to genes involved in the biosynthesis of biomedically important NPs produced by bacteria originally collected from natural environments around the world suggests that bacteria producing these same families of clinically important antibiotics, antifungals, and anticancer agents are actually present in the soils of New York City. The identification of new bacterial NPs often centers on the systematic exploration of bacteria present in natural environments. Here, we find that the soil microbiomes found in large cities likely hold similar promise as rich unexplored sources of clinically relevant NPs.","Many bee species are declining globally, but to detect trends and monitor bee assemblages, robust sampling methods are required. Numerous sampling methods are used, but a critical review of their relative effectiveness is lacking. Moreover, evidence suggests the relative effectiveness of sampling methods depends on habitat, yet efficacy in urban areas has yet to be evaluated. This study compared the bee community documented using observational records, targeted netting, mobile gardens, pan traps (blue and yellow), vane traps (blue and yellow), and trap-nests. The comparative surveys of native bees and honeybees were undertaken in an urbanized region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hot spot. The outcomes of the study were then compared to a synthesis based on a comprehensive literature review of studies where two or more bee sampling methods were conducted. Observational records far exceeded all other methods in terms of abundance of bees recorded, but were unable to distinguish finer taxonomic levels. Of methods that captured individuals, thereby permitting taxonomic identification, targeted sweep netting vastly outperformed the passive sampling methods, yielding a total of 1324 individuals, representing 131 taxonomic units—even when deployed over a shorter duration. The relative effectiveness of each method differed according to taxon. From the analysis of the literature, there was high variability in relative effectiveness of methods, but targeted sweep netting and blue vane traps tended to be most effective, in accordance with results from this study. However, results from the present study differed from most previous studies in the extremely low catch rates in pan traps. Species using trap-nests represented only a subset of all potential cavity-nesters, and their relative abundances in the trap-nests differed from those in the field. Mobile gardens were relatively ineffective at attracting bees. For urbanized habitat within this biodiversity hot spot, targeted sweep netting is indispensable for obtaining a comprehensive indication of native bee assemblages; passive sampling methods alone recorded only a small fraction of the native bee community. Overall, a combination of methods should be used for sampling bee communities, as each has their own biases, and certain taxa were well represented in some methods, but poorly represented in","Africa, a continent exceptionally rich in biodiversity, is rapidly urbanizing. Africa’s urbanization is manifest in the growth of its megacities as well as that of its smaller towns and cities. The conservation planning and practice will increasingly need to account for direct and indirect impacts of the continent’s urbanization. The objective of our study is to pinpoint the outstanding challenges and opportunities afforded by the growing cities on the continent to the conservation goals and practices. While there have been many studies on the impacts of urbanization and development on conservation in Africa these studies tended to focus on specific issues. Here, we provide a synthesis of this body of work supported by new analysis. Urban areas, growing both in population and in land cover, pose threats to the integrity of the continent’s ecosystems and biodiversity but their growth also create opportunities for conservation. The burgeoning urban populations, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, increase the strain on already insufficient infrastructure and bring new governance challenges. Yet, Africa’s ecosystems can serve as foundations for green infrastructure to serve the needs of its urban populations while safeguarding fragile biodiversity. Overall, while worsening social problems overshadow the concerns for biodiversity there are also promising initiatives to bring these concerns into the fold to address social, institutional, and ecological challenges that emerge with the continued urbanization of the continent.","Executive summary \n \nUrban sprawl is associated with a number of ecological, economic and social effects. Some of these relate to people's desires, for example, to live in single-family homes with gardens. However, urban sprawl has detrimental and long-lasting effects. For example, urban sprawl contributes significantly to the loss of fertile farmland, to soil sealing and to the loss of ecological soil functions. The increase in built-up areas reduces the size of wildlife habitats and increases landscape fragmentation and the spread of invasive species. Urban sprawl leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions, higher infrastructure costs for transport, water and electrical power, the loss of open landscapes, and the degradation of various ecosystem services. Despite various efforts to address this problem, urban sprawl has increased rapidly in Europe in recent decades. Thus, urban sprawl presents a major challenge with regard to sustainable land use, as the International Year of Soils 2015 highlighted. \n \nSprawl is a result not only of population growth but also of lifestyles that take up more space. Accordingly, urban sprawl has increased even in regions with a declining human population. Many more urban development and transport infrastructure projects are planned for the future, in particular in the European Union (EU) Member States which joined after 2004. Consequently, further increases in urban sprawl in the future will be significant. Therefore, consistent data on the degree of urban sprawl are needed, particularly data that are suitable for the comparison of regions across Europe. This report investigates the degree of urban sprawl in 32 countries in Europe by considering two points in time (2006 and 2009) at three levels. The three levels include the country level, the NUTS-2 region level (based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)) and the 1-km2 cell level (based on the Land and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) grid). The comparison of two points in time allowed an assessment of temporal changes in urban sprawl. \n \nThis report applies the method of 'weighted urban proliferation' (WUP), which quantifies the degree of urban sprawl for any given landscape through a combination of three components: (1) the size of the built-up areas; (2) the spatial configuration (dispersion) of the built-up areas in the landscape; and (3) the uptake of built-up area per inhabitant or job. The report provides, for the first time, an assessment of urban sprawl in all EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries using the WUP method. The urban sprawl values obtained cover a large range, from low values for large parts of Scandinavia ( 4 UPU/m2) and very high values for large parts of western and central Europe (&gt; 6 UPU/m2). The two largest clusters of high-sprawl values in Europe are located in (1) north-eastern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and part of western Germany; and (2) in the United Kingdom between London and the Midlands. The analysis of sprawl at the 1-km2-grid level shows that sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors, and along many coastlines (particularly in the Mediterranean countries). The lowest levels of sprawl are mainly associated with mountain ranges or remote areas. The level of sprawl, as measured by WUP, increased in all European countries between 2006 and 2009. The overall WUP value for Europe (all 32 countries combined) increased from 1.56 urban permeation units (UPU)/m2 in 2006 to 1.64 UPU/m2 in 2009, that is by 5 % in 3 years or by 1.7 % per year. In most countries, the increase was higher than 1 % per year, and in many countries WUP increased by more than 2 % per year. This was also the case for most NUTS-2 regions. Future studies using additional time-points will allow more detailed temporal comparisons. Base data for 2012 will be available in 2016 and these could be analysed in a follow-up project. \n \nDriving forces and predictive models of urban sprawl \n \nThe level of urban sprawl is largely a function of socio-economic and demographic drivers, and the geophysical context. Current levels of urban sprawl need to be interpreted within the context of regional socio-economic and geophysical conditions. Therefore, the second part of this study investigated the potential factors that may contribute to an increase or decrease in the degree of urban sprawl, and determined their relative importance. The report applied a set of statistical models to determine which of these factors drive the process of urban sprawl in Europe. We analysed the statistical relationships between urban sprawl and a range of explanatory variables (14 variables at the country level and 12 at the NUTS-2 level). We also applied these relationships to predict the expected sprawl values for all regions in our study area and compared actual values with predicted values. \n \nMost of our hypotheses about the likely driving forces of urban sprawl were confirmed by the statistical analyses. The relevant variables identified as affecting urban sprawl are population density, road density, railway density, household size, governmental effectiveness, the number of cars per 1 000 inhabitants and two environmental factors (i.e. net primary production and relief energy). This result was consistent for both of the years (2006 and 2009) considered in the analysis. The results indicate that economic development has, largely, not been decoupled from increases in urban sprawl. A high amount of variation in the level of urban sprawl, as measured by WUP, was explained by the predictor variables: 72–80 % at the country level and 80–81 % at the NUTS-2 level. The variation explained for the three components of WUP ranged between 67 % and 94 % at the NUTS-2 level. Efforts to control urban sprawl should take these driving forces into account. \n \nRelevance for monitoring and policymaking \n \nThe results provided by this study are intended to contribute to more sustainable political decision- making and planning throughout Europe. In the last 15 years (2000–2015), several projects and programmes at the European level have proposed a suite of concepts and measures to address urban sprawl and promote more sustainable land use. The most recent (2014), and perhaps most important, of these is the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7EAP), which calls for indicators of resource efficiency to be established in order to guide public and private decision-makers. Although the urgent challenge presented by urban sprawl has been recognised, there is still no monitoring in place for European urban sprawl. This report aims to help close this gap. \n \nThe results confirm the conclusion of earlier reports (e.g. EEA, 2006a; EEA, 2006b) namely that there is an increasingly urgent need for action. Large discrepancies between the predicted and observed levels of urban sprawl provide a basis for identifying areas for prioritising management action. Our data also provide a basis for scenarios regarding the future development of urban sprawl in Europe. There is an increasing need and interest in including indicators of urban sprawl in systems for monitoring sustainable development, the state of the environment, biodiversity and landscape quality. The results presented in this report are intended for this purpose and can be updated on a regular basis in order to detect trends in urban sprawl. This report also demonstrates the usefulness of the WUP method as a tool for urban and regional planning and for performance review based on benchmarks, targets and limits. \n \nThis study provides a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for most of the European continent using a consistent data set across Europe. The results will support managers and policymakers with the allocation of resources for the better protection of agricultural soils and landscape quality, and more sustainable political decision-making related to land use. The report also identifies the most immediate priorities and future research needs.","Land-use change models are used in a variety of fields such as planning, urban science, ecological science, climate science, geography, watershed hydrology, environmental science, political science, and transportation to examine future land-use scenarios as well as to evaluate the potential effects of policies directed toward engendering a socially or economically or ecologically desirable pattern of future land-use that minimizes negative externalities. More recently, there has been substantial attention in the scientific literature on biodiversity loss, deforestation consequences, and carbon emissions increases caused by patterns of urban and rural land-use development, and associated climate change impacts . In this paper, we contribute to the vibrant and interdisciplinary literature on land-use analysis by proposing a new econometric approach to specify and estimate a model of land-use change that is capable of predicting both the type and intensity of urban development patterns over large geographic areas, while also explicitly acknowledging geographic proximity-based spatial dependencies in these patterns. As such, the motivations of this paper stem both from an empirical perspective as well as a methodological perspective. At an empirical level , the paper models land-use in multiple discrete states, along with the area invested in each land-use discrete state, within each spatial unit in an entire urban region. The spatial unit of analysis is a quarter-of-a-mile square grid, within which there can be multiple land-uses with associated land areas. At a methodological level , the paper focuses on specifying and estimating a spatial multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) probit model. To our knowledge, this is the first formulation and attempt to include spatial dependency patterns originating from both the systematic component (sometimes referred to as “spillover effects”) as well as spatial effects originating from the unobserved component (in the literature, it is typical to use the label “spatial” only if the latter effects are accommodated) in MDC models. . Further, the two dominant techniques, both based on simulation methods, for the estimation of standard discrete choice models with spatial dependence are the frequentist recursive importance sampling (RIS) estimator and the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based estimator. However, both of these methods are confronted with multi-dimensional normal integration, and are cumbersome to implement in typical empirical contexts with even moderate estimation sample sizes. In the current paper, we show how Bhat’s maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach can be gainfully applied for the estimation of a spatial multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) model. This method is easy to implement, require no simulation, and involve only univariate and bivariate cumulative normal distribution function evaluations, regardless of the number of alternatives or the number of choice occasions per observation unit, or the number of observation units, or the nature of social/spatial dependence structures. The spatial MDCP formulation also accommodates spatial heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity in the dependent variable, and should be applicable in a wide variety of fields where social and spatial dependencies between decision agents (or observation units) lead to spillover effects in multiple discrete-continuous choices (or states).","Abstract. Improving biodiversity in urban areas is widely recognised as part of sustainable smart cities development framework. Due to unprecedented urbanisation, there is a lack of adequate green spaces which has in turn affected the urban biodiversity. Green roofs are argued to enhance and support the biodiversity by systematic inclusion into the urban ecological network. However, its connection to the existing natural ecological areas and connectivity are not discussed at a city scale. Thus, in this study, we aim at identifying the connectivity of potential areas for developing green roofs in strengthening the biodiversity and ecological network in cities. Altogether, we observe that the potential roofs are in the near proximity of these zones. The zones with dry lawns and meadows like environment are quite limited and spatially far from each other. Thus, developing green roofs can help in connecting these spaces. In this paper, we mainly focused on bees as they play an important role in pollination and are also declining in the urban areas. Further research can incorporate more detailed analysis on foraging distances of other species. A methodology can be developed to select which zones can be targeted for specific species.\n","Biological invasions are acknowledged among the main drivers of global changes in biodiversity. Despite compelling evidence of species interactions being strongly regulated by environmental conditions, there is a dearth of studies investigating how the effects of non-native species vary among areas exposed to different anthropogenic pressures. Focusing on marine macroalgae, we performed a meta-analysis to test whether and how the direction and magnitude of their effects on resident communities and species varies in relation to cumulative anthropogenic impact levels. The relationship between human impact levels and non-native species impact intensity emerged only for a reduced subset of the response variables examined. Yet, there was a trend for the effects of non-native species on community biomass and abundance and on species abundance to become less negative at heavily impacted sites. By contrast, the magnitude of negative effects of seaweed on community evenness tended to increase with human impact levels. The hypothesis of decreasing severity of invader’ impacts along a gradient of habitat degradation was also tested experimentally at a regional scale by comparing the effects of the removal of non-native alga, Caulerpa cylindracea, on resident assemblages among rocky reefs exposed to different anthropogenic pressures. Assemblages at urban and pristine site did not differ when invaded, but did so when C. cylindracea was removed. Our results suggest that, despite the generally weak relationship between human impacts levels and nonnative species impacts, more negative impacts can be expected in less stressful environments (i.e. less degraded or pristine sites), where competitive interactions are presumably the driving force structuring resident communities. Implementing strategies for controlling the establishment of non-native seaweeds should be, thus, considered a priority for preserving biodiversity in relatively pristine areas. On the other hand, control of invaders at degraded sites could be warranted to lessen their role as propagule sources.","With its multiple dimensions and functions, urban agriculture has the potential to contribute to a sustainable urban development process, depending on how it is executed and who is included. In this study, we promoted multi-stakeholder dialogue about the outlook of urban agriculture in Maputo and Cape Town in form of interviews, meetings, field visits, farmers’ meetings and scenario-building workshops. The goal was to create a common vision with the different actors – farmers and gardeners, non-governmental organizations, social movements, enterprises, scientists and policy makers – and to develop strategic measures for positive change that served as the basis for formulating recommendations. In Maputo, thousands of small-holder farmers are well-organized and there are many actors who have the will to promote agriculture within the city. However, the political institutions that deal with urban agriculture lack commitment to address urban agricultural issues. Therefore, we propose a set of strategies that range from the creation of multidisciplinary working groups to the mapping of available arable land in the city. On the other hand, although the level of political institutionalization is much higher in Cape Town – a city with a big variety of different urban gardens and fields, we found that the focus of most stakeholders on resilient urban food systems is not well approached. The recommendations build on a range of strategies from the conduction of workshops about logistics for small-holder farmers to the creation of awareness on ecological issues, fair food production and conscious consumption. Problem statement and study objectives A growing human population and rapid urbanization make sustainable planning of urban areas one of the most challenging issues of the 21st century. Cities must meet many different needs of citizens, including housing, infrastructure, income generation, health, social justice and the enormous demand on the urban food system. We assume that urban agriculture can play a role as part of a sustainable development towards resilient cities and urban food systems. Short transportation routes that bring food to the consumer, income generation for the producer, an increase of biodiversity and air quality due to more green spaces in the city and the possibility for citizens to get involved in community projects in their neighborhoods are only some of the examples of possible positive impacts of urban agriculture on its environment. However, urban planners and political decixviii Executive summary sion makers are often not prepared to integrate urban agriculture into cities’ plans for the future. Because land in and around cities is limited and manifold alternative uses are possible, urban agriculture is often threatened by competition for land and has to take place under semi-legal and precarious conditions. The potential lies in overcoming those constraints by mediating these different interests. Hence, we created a participatory stakeholder dialogue with the goal of creating a common vision among the key actors and analyzed the necessary conditions for the sustainable future of urban agriculture in Maputo and Cape Town. We always tried to build upon pre-existing research, institutional structures and processes. We gathered key actors, from farmers to policy makers, to discuss the future role of urban agriculture within and beyond the urban food system. Conceptual framework and local context Urban agriculture is an umbrella term for different types of agriculture and horticulture within (intra-urban) or on the fringe (peri-urban) of a city which grows or raises, processes, and distributes a diversity of food and non-food products. It (re-)uses largely human resources and products to provide services for the local environment with multifunctional ecological, socio-cultural, sanitary and economic impacts (Halder, 2018, p. 113; Mougeot 2000). Studies estimate that over 800 million people practice urban agriculture worldwide (Hoornweg &amp; Munro-Faure, 2008, p. 22). Due to disparities of the local context in Cape Town and Maputo and their urban agriculture practices, the particularities of each city are described below, as the project strongly focuses on the specific needs of local actors and considered existing local structures. Urban agriculture plays an important role in the city of Maputo, especially regarding the economic dimension. The agricultural sector employs about 66,200 people directly and is responsible for 8 percent of the city’s gross income. Moreover, urban agriculture in Maputo provides food for 22% of households (White &amp; Hamm, 2017). Farmers in Maputo are small-holders peasant. They produce mainly fast growing vegetables like lettuce and kale, which are usually purchased directly by intermediaries in or near the fields and sold on local markets, leaving small profit margin for the farmers. One particularity of the capital city are the zonas verdes, extensive green belts in the urban and peri-urban area. Most producers are affiliated with associations and cooperatives. Some of the challenges they face are inappropriate and extensive use of agro-chemicals and salinization of soil. With respect to the political framework, there is little governmental protection for Executive summary xix land used for agricultural purposes and no differentiation between rural and urban agricultural activities. Cape Town has a diverse urban agriculture scene that includes different farmers, gardeners, NGOs, social movements, private enterprises, governmental actors, research institutions and other stakeholders. Likewise, the types of farming practiced is also diverse. In the Cape Flats, the predominant forms of agricultural practice are home and community gardens. Approximately 4,000 home gardens (with a size of Ø 6-12 m) and approximately 100 community gardens (with a size of Ø 600 m) produce a variety of horticultural products which are either consumed by the producers themselves or, to a small degree, marketed with the support of NGOs in the form of vegetable boxes sold to households, as well as to “lifestyle markets” and trendy restaurants in the city center. In the Philippi Horticulture Area and in the peri-urban areas, bigger commercial farms prevail. The urban farmland of the Philippi Horticulture Area produces 100,000 tons of fresh produce annually on 3,000 hectares. Urban agriculture in Cape Town plays an important multifunctional role, ranging from providing food to building communities creating spaces for environmental education. But the challenges urban farmers face, threaten the continuity and sustainability of this practices. For instance, little legal protection or land rights for the agricultural land in the city, the urban food insecurity in general, the situation of climate change, water scarcity and restrictions, as well as a lack of training and experience. Research framework and methodology Our project is part of the interdisciplinary research project Urban Agriculture for Food Security and Income Generation in South Africa and Mozambique (UFISAMO), implemented by a consortium of German, Mozambican, and South African universities, state departments and civil society organizations. The main goals of the UFISAMO project are to contribute to improved food and nutrition security of the poor urban population and to increase income generation by optimizing production, processing and marketing of agricultural and livestock products. This is done through the different working packages (WP) such as value chains analysis (WP1), risks and benefits of crop production and livestock production (WP2), a research and education network (WP3), as well as the transfer of research results into practice and policies (WP4). Our work lies between the WP3 and WP4, thus one of the main objectives of this study was to strengthen the dialogue between different key actors in Maputo and Cape Town (i.e. producers, NGOs, research organizations, government and policy agencies, and the private sector) to foster cooperation between these xx Executive summary stakeholders and create a common understanding of different aims and interests, as well as a joint vision for urban agriculture. Another essential objective of this study was developing recommendations for strategic interventions that support integrating urban agriculture into a sustainable development process for the cities of Cape Town and Maputo. The most important basis for the specific recommendations made was the input of participants in the participatory workshops we organized, one farmers’ meeting and one scenario building workshop in each city. This was complemented by literature review, the analysis of the political framework, interests of the different key actors, good practices from other cities and expert interviews. This combination allowed us to give suitable recommendations tailored to the local context, while also leveraging existing local structures and knowledge. Results and recommendations The potential of Maputo’s urban agriculture lies in the existence of extensive green zones dedicated to agriculture in the city and the organizational structure of farmers in associations. Indeed, this potential can be leveraged through strategic measures, ranging from the creation of transversal working groups to deal with the multi-dimensional aspects of urban agriculture to concrete technical solutions like the mapping of available arable land in the city. According to the workshop participants, the following challenges and recommendations are those considered the most important to resolve and initiate: Financial services Small-holder farmers lack access to credit, partly due to insufficient offers of services and products suitable for their needs (e.g. high interest and monthly payments, despite the seasonal nature of agriculture). This is also due to farmers’ inability to meet the requirements of finance institutions. Hence, the main recommendation","The aim of this overview paper is to analyze the use of various landscape metrics and landscape indices for the characterization of landscape structure and various processes at both landscape and ecosystem level. We analyzed the appearance of the terms landscape metrics/indexes/indices in combination with seven main categories in the field of landscape ecology (1) use/selection and misuse of metrics, 2) biodiversity and habitat analysis; 3) water quality; 4) evaluation of the landscape pattern and its change; 5) urban landscape pattern, road network; 6) aesthetics of landscape; 7) management, planning and monitoring) in the titles, abstracts and/or key words of research papers published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals indexed by the Institute of Science Information (ISI) Web of Science (WoS) from 1994 to October 2008. Most of the landscape metrics and indices are used concerning biodiversity and habitat analysis, and also the evaluation of landscape pattern and its change (up to 25 articles per year). There are only a few articles on the relationships of landscape metrics/indices/indexes to social aspects and landscape perception.","During the last several decades, the quality of natural resources and their services have been exposed to significant degradation from increased urban populations combined with the sprawl of settlements, development of transportation networks and industrial activities (Dorsey, 2003; Pauleit et al., 2005). As a result of this environmental degradation, a sustainable framework for urban development is required to provide the resilience of natural resources and ecosystems. Sustainable urban development refers to the management of cities with adequate infrastructure to support the needs of its population for the present and future generations as well as maintain the sustainability of its ecosystems (UNEP/IETC, 2002; Yigitcanlar, 2010). One of the important strategic approaches for planning sustainable cities is „ecological planning‟. Ecological planning is a multi-dimensional concept that aims to preserve biodiversity richness and ecosystem productivity through the sustainable management of natural resources (Barnes et al., 2005). As stated by Baldwin (1985, p.4), ecological planning is the initiation and operation of activities to direct and control the acquisition, transformation, disruption and disposal of resources in a manner capable of sustaining human activities with a minimum disruption of ecosystem processes. Therefore, ecological planning is a powerful method for creating sustainable urban ecosystems. \n \nIn order to explore the city as an ecosystem and investigate the interaction between the urban ecosystem and human activities, a holistic urban ecosystem sustainability assessment approach is required. Urban ecosystem sustainability assessment serves as a tool that helps policy and decision-makers in improving their actions towards sustainable urban development. There are several methods used in urban ecosystem sustainability assessment among which sustainability indicators and composite indices are the most commonly used tools for assessing the progress towards sustainable land use and urban management. Currently, a variety of composite indices are available to measure the sustainability at the local, national and international levels. However, the main conclusion drawn from the literature review is that they are too broad to be applied to assess local and micro level sustainability and no benchmark value for most of the indicators exists due to limited data availability and non-comparable data across countries. Mayer (2008, p. 280) advocates that by stating \"as different as the indices may seem, many of them incorporate the same underlying data because of the small number of available sustainability datasets\". Mori and Christodoulou (2011) also argue that this relative evaluation and comparison brings along biased assessments, as data only exists for some entities, which also means excluding many nations from evaluation and comparison. Thus, there is a need for developing an accurate and comprehensive micro-level urban ecosystem sustainability assessment method. In order to develop such a model, it is practical to adopt an approach that uses a method to utilise indicators for collecting data, designate certain threshold values or ranges, perform a comparative sustainability assessment via indices at the micro-level, and aggregate these assessment findings to the local level. Hereby, through this approach and model, it is possible to produce sufficient and reliable data to enable comparison at the local level, and provide useful results to inform the local planning, conservation and development decision-making process to secure sustainable ecosystems and urban futures. To advance research in this area, this study investigated the environmental impacts of an existing urban context by using a composite index with an aim to identify the interaction between urban ecosystems and human activities in the context of environmental sustainability. In this respect, this study developed a new comprehensive urban ecosystem sustainability assessment tool entitled the „Micro-level Urban-ecosystem Sustainability IndeX‟ (MUSIX). The MUSIX model is an indicator-based indexing model that investigates the factors affecting urban sustainability in a local context. The model outputs provide local and micro-level sustainability reporting guidance to help policy-making concerning environmental issues. \n \nA multi-method research approach, which is based on both quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, was employed in the construction of the MUSIX model. First, a qualitative research was conducted through an interpretive and critical literature review in developing a theoretical framework and indicator selection. Afterwards, a quantitative research was conducted through statistical and spatial analyses in data collection, processing and model application. The MUSIX model was tested in four pilot study sites selected from the Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia. The model results detected the sustainability performance of current urban settings referring to six main issues of urban development: (1) hydrology, (2) ecology, (3) pollution, (4) location, (5) design, and; (6) efficiency. For each category, a set of core indicators was assigned which are intended to: (1) benchmark the current situation, strengths and weaknesses, (2) evaluate the efficiency of implemented plans, and; (3) measure the progress towards sustainable development. While the indicator set of the model provided specific information about the environmental impacts in the area at the parcel scale, the composite index score provided general information about the sustainability of the area at the neighbourhood scale. Finally, in light of the model findings, integrated ecological planning strategies were developed to guide the preparation and assessment of development and local area plans in conjunction with the Gold Coast Planning Scheme, which establishes regulatory provisions to achieve ecological sustainability through the formulation of place codes, development codes, constraint codes and other assessment criteria that provide guidance for best practice development solutions. These relevant strategies can be summarised as follows: \n \n• Establishing hydrological conservation through sustainable stormwater management in order to preserve the Earth’s water cycle and aquatic ecosystems; \n \n• Providing ecological conservation through sustainable ecosystem management in order to protect biological diversity and maintain the integrity of natural ecosystems; \n \n• Improving environmental quality through developing pollution prevention regulations and policies in order to promote high quality water resources, clean air and enhanced ecosystem health; \n \n• Creating sustainable mobility and accessibility through designing better local services and walkable neighbourhoods in order to promote safe environments and healthy communities; \n \n• Sustainable design of urban environment through climate responsive design in order to increase the efficient use of solar energy to provide thermal comfort, and; \n \n• Use of renewable resources through creating efficient communities in order to provide long-term management of natural resources for the sustainability of future generations.","Looking at the trend of the country’s development and international concern on biodiversity in Malaysia, the government has developed a policy on conservation, biodiversity and many other policies related to the environment and biodiversity.Despite many policies, laws and regulations and commitment of many agencies on \nenvironmental protection and conservation, issues on biodiversity, conservation and protection are continuously highlighted. The demands for agriculture, industries, urbanisation and road networking have sacrificed the habitats for wildlife. The lack of \nexpertise and public awareness on wildlife ecology and conservation caused the local authorities and developers to neglect planning for wildlife and habitat protection when designing the developments of the urban, industrial and residential areas. Many examples of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, migration routes obstruction, poaching and habitat contamination have occurred. Great pressures \ncan be observed on coastal wildlife. Hazardous chemicals in coastal environment in Malaysia have shown some elevation especially in specific areas. Realising that continuous developments and human activities can cause the elevation of hazardous chemicals in the \ncoastal environment, a monitoring system is needed. In order to do this, bio-monitoring agents need to be identified and tested. From the long studies that I have conducted, many bio-monitoring agents have been proposed. Many of them are intertidal molluscs. However, more detailed studies on their biology and ecology are \nrequired. From these long term monitoring activities that were carried out, the Department of Biology, UPM has produced the most data with similar sampling methods, analysis and procedures in the literature on level and ecotoxicology of heavy metals in Malaysia. \nPerhaps the data produced can become guidelines for heavy metal levels in coastal marine ecosystems in Malaysia. Since heavy metals are important hazardous chemicals that can cause toxic effects, monitoring and research related to establishing bio-indicators, \nbio-monitors and testing organisms need to be continuously enhanced. The results of understanding the biology, ecology and ecotoxicology of heavy metals on the potential bio-indicators will enable a specific bio-indicator to be suggested for a specific micro-habitat. Establishing a specific bio-indicator for a specific \nmicro-habitat could support the idea of conservation of organisms at all levels from chemical contamination. This innovation can later aid hazardous chemical management in coastal environment and help to reduce the conflict between coastal wildlife conservation and pollution.","Abstract This research is based on the management principle that watershed land cover is a better predictor of pond biodiversity than primary productivity. Ponds in watersheds with more than 30% lawn cover have few zooplankton species, no macrophytes, no snails, and no amphibians. A recent meta-analysis generated the hypothesis that watershed (catchment basin) land cover is a better predictor of lake biodiversity than traditional predictors (such as in-lake primary productivity) if the watershed includes human development (agriculture, residential, or urban). This hypothesis was tested via a field survey of 23 similar-sized artificial ponds in southern Wisconsin. The ponds had similar climate and geology, but differed in the relative proportions of land cover in the watershed. Twelve environmental variables (including pond area, depth, and primary productivity surrogates) and seven watershed land cover variables were correlated with biodiversity measures of seven major aquatic communities. Percent lawn cover was negatively correlated with zooplankton richness (r2 = 0.41), macrophyte abundance (r2 = 61), molluscan presence (r2 = 0.48), and amphibian presence (r2 = 0.55 for spring species and r2 = 0.78 for summer species). Fish presence was negatively correlated with percent watershed covered by meadow (r2 = 0.16). Chlorophyll a (a primary productivity surrogate) was negatively correlated with three groups: zooplankton richness (r2 = 0.18), macrophyte abundance (r2 = 0.23), and molluscan presence/absence (r2 = 0.31). Total phosphorus and nitrogen (surrogates of in-lake primary productivity) were weakly correlated with biodiversity.","Abstract The geographic location of Israel and the Palestinian Authorityon the border between Mediterranean and desert climate, and the strong topographic and geomorphological variation resulting from its position on the Great African Rift Valley, combine to sustain a great diversity of landscapes in a very small country. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the protected areas in Israel and the Palestinian Authority adequately represent the range of landscapes and ecosystems in the region. Altogether, we defined 23 natural ecosystem-units in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, of which 17 are terrestrial landscapes and 6 are aquatic systems. In considering the adequacy of coverage in protected areas, we mapped Israel and the Palestinian Authority landscapes according to a set of environmental factors (climatic, geomorphological, geological and botanical) that we believe most effectively distinguish landscape types in this region. When the separation between adjacent units relies on sharp topographic or edaphic change in the landscape, the mapped units can be separated by a clear and sharp line. When adjacent units are actually a gradient of continuous environmental conditions the separation lines relied mostly on botanic characteristics. The main land use categories in this analysis were urban areas, agricultural areas, nature reserves, national parks and forest reserves. For the first time in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, we quantified the different landscape types under the different categories of land use. This process, known as systematic conservation planning, allowed us to detect natural landscapes that are underrepresented in protected areas, and can guide decision makers to establish or improve management for the better representation of biodiversity.","Background In spite of the strides made globally in reducing hunger, the problems of micronutrient deficiencies and coexisting obesity and related cardiovascular and degenerative diseases constitute a formidable challenge for the future. Attempts to reverse this trend with single-nutrient intervention strategies have met with limited success, resulting in renewed calls for food-based approaches. The deployment of agricultural biodiversity is an approach that entails greater use of local biodiversity to ensure dietary diversity. Objective To outline a new strategy proposed by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) that employs agricultural biodiversity as the primary resource for food security and health. Methods The authors carried out a meta-analysis to review and assemble existing information on the nutritional and healthful properties of traditional foods based on a diverse set of case studies and food composition and nutritional analysis studies. The methods highlight particular examples of foods where analysis of nutrient and non-nutrient composition reveals important traits to address the growing problems of malnutrition associated with the rise of chronic diseases. Finally, the authors analyze social, economic, and cultural changes that undermine the healthful components of traditional diets. Results Based on this multidisciplinary and comparative approach, the authors suggest a holistic food-based approach that combines research to assess and document nutritional and healthful properties of traditional foods, investigating options in which nutritionally valuable traditional foods can contribute to better livelihoods, and ways that awareness and promotional campaigns can identify healthful components of traditional diets that fit the needs of urban and market-oriented consumers. Conclusions There is an urgent need for agricultural research centers, national agricultural research systems, universities, and community-based organizations to work together under a shared policy framework with the aim of developing a strong evidence base linking biodiversity, nutrition, and health. Although these initiatives are still ongoing, the gains realized in small-scale and local pilot efforts have encouraged IPGRI to work with local partners toward the implementation of scale-up efforts in various regions.","Australia’s terrestrial environment has been dramatically modified since European colonisation. Deforestation – the clearing and modification of native forest for agricultural, urban and industrial development – remains a significant threat to Australia’s biodiversity. Substantial policy reform over the last 40 years has delivered a range of policy instruments aimed to control deforestation across all Australian States and Territories. Despite these policy efforts – as well as strong governance and high institutional capacity – deforestation rates in Australia were nonetheless globally significant at the turn of this century. Legislation introduced in Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-2000s was at the time seen to have effectively ended broad-scale clearing; however, recent policy changes have raised concerns that Australia may again become a global hotspot for deforestation. Here, I describe the deforestation trends, drivers and policy responses in Australia over the last four decades. Using satellite imagery of forest cover and deforestation events across Australia between 1972 and 2014, I present a comprehensive analysis of deforestation rates at a fine resolution. I discuss trends in deforestation with reference to the institutional, macroeconomic and environmental conditions that are associated with human-induced forest loss in Australia. I provide a detailed history and critique of the native vegetation policies introduced across Australia over the last 40 years, including recent legislative amendments and reviews. Finally, I comment on future prospects for curbing deforestation in Australia, including the role of incentive-based policies such as carbon farming, private land conservation and biodiversity offsets. Despite being a highly active policy space, very little is known of the effectiveness of policy responses to deforestation in Australia, and whether the recent shift away from ‘command and control’ policies will necessarily lead to better outcomes. My analysis demonstrates the need for an effective policy mix to curb deforestation in Australia, including a greater focus on monitoring, evaluation and policy learning.","Roughly a third of described insect species visit flowers, making the flower-insect interface one of the chief pillars of global biodiversity. Studying flower-insect relationships at the scale of communities and landscapes has been hindered, however, by the methodological challenges of quantifying landscape-scale floral resources. This challenge is especially acute in urban landscapes, where traditional floral surveying techniques are ill-suited to the unique constraints of built environments. To surmount these challenges, we devised a “honey bee foraging assay” approach to floral resource surveying, wherein continuous colony weight tracking and DNA metabarcoding of pollen samples are used to capture both the overall availability and taxonomic composition of floral resources. We deploy this methodology in the complex urban ecosystem of Philadelphia, PA, U.S. Our results reveal distinct seasonality of floral resource availability, with pulses of high availability in May, June, and September, and a period of prolonged scarcity in August. Pollen genus richness mirrored this pattern, with peak richness in May and June. The taxonomic composition of pollen samples varied seasonally, reflecting underlying floral phenology, with especially strong turnover between May and June samples and between August and September samples delineating well-defined spring, summer, and fall floral resource communities. Trait analysis also revealed marked seasonal structure, with spring samples characterized by trees and shrubs, summer samples including a stronger presence of herbaceous “weeds”, and fall samples dominated by woody vines. Native flora predominated in spring, giving way to a preponderance of exotic flora in summer and fall. Our study provides a detailed portrait of floral resources in a complex urban environment. At a basic level, this yields insight into the assembly of novel urban floral resource communities, showcasing, for example, the emergence of a woody-vine-dominated fall flora. At an applied level, our data can inform urban land management, such as the design of ecologically functional ornamental plantings, while also providing practical guidance to beekeepers seeking to adapt their management activities to floral resource seasonality. Methodologically, our study demonstrates the potential of the honey bee foraging assay as an efficient and standardizable technique for landscape-scale floral resource surveying.","Ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation are promoted at international, national, and local levels by both scholars and practitioners. However, local planning practices that support these approaches are scattered, and measures are neither systematically implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation, which is an important factor in only around half of all measures. Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate measures/designs, related operations, and policy processes at different scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in municipal governance and planning.","AIM \nThe aim of this research was to examine the potential for mitigation of predominantly pluvial flooding in CBDs through retrofitting of such systems. The research used two case study areas to explore the challenges and opportunities for retrofit of SUDS in different cities with varying climate zones, urban design and governmental regimes. The research sought to: \na) Evaluate the potential to physically retrofit existing buildings and adjacent paved areas \nb) Explore the potential for run of reduction and therefore mitigation of associated flood damage \nc) Examine the costs and benefits of retrofitting SUDS and identify social and environmental benefits of sustainable drainage for commercial property and the business district. \nIn order to provide information and guidance for surveyors in the emerging area of retrofit of SUDS and provide material to build capacity of surveyors to contribute to improved drainage and flood mitigation for commercial property. \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe research commenced with a systematic literature review to identify the available information on the use and retrofit of SUDS to reduce flood risk. International databases of both academic and industry sources were accessed thereby creating a global picture of examples, together with available tools and guidance likely to be of benefit to the surveying community. Using information drawn from the literature, criteria were developed to determine the technical requirements that determine suitability of roofs and paving areas for retrofit including the position, orientation and location of the building, the roof pitch, weight limitations and ground conditions. Two detailed building databases were then developed for Melbourne, Australia and Newcastle, UK. The databases were compiled drawing on a wide range of sources, including existing commercial and publicly available databases, Google maps and visual inspections. The final building databases contained 526 commercial buildings in Melbourne and 507 commercial buildings in Newcastle. The technical criteria were used to identify those buildings which had the potential to be retrofitted and to estimate the potential for retrofit of permeable paving. A simple estimation method was applied to the data derived from the property databases and available land use data to assess the potential run-off reduction under three scenarios. For the Melbourne dataset a further run-off analysis was carried out on the behalf of the research by the University of Newcastle using a state of the art rainfall inundation model. \n \nRESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS \nThe most appropriate and well understood SUDS for retrofit in city centre locations are green roofs, permeable paving and rain gardens. Combination of these features into a ‘management train’ or ‘treatment train’ (a linked series of drainage techniques) can increase the attenuation potential of individual features. The evidence base for estimating the direct benefits of SUDS retrofit is rapidly developing. Both academic studies and city-wide assessments have been undertaken. For green roofs, benefits accrue to individual property owners in terms of reduced energy bills owing to the insulating properties of such roofs. The broader stakeholder community also derives benefits from green SUDS installation, such as roofs and rain gardens, some of which are less easily monetised. They include: biodiversity/wildlife habitat; improvements in water and air quality; and attenuation of the urban heat island effect. Green roofs also have a carbon sequestration function. \nThe range of benefits of permeable paving are more limited and relate to stormwater management and water quality. However permeable paving may have a lifecycle cost advantage over other paving systems thereby representing a no regret option for renewal of urban paving. \nThe consideration of the full range of benefits and their applicability from the perspective of actors engaged in the installation of measures is a recent development in the literature and has not yet been explored for commercial property owners and investors. \nThe database analysis of buildings within two city centres revealed that the proportion with potential for retrofit of green roofs is fairly low (under conservative assumptions). Estimation of other surfaces potentially suitable for permeable retrofit in busy business districts also reveals that a large proportion of urban hard surface may be unsuitable for standard permeable paving systems. \nEstimation of the run off reduction potential for these two cases study areas can be seen to be realistically around 10-20%, however this can still make a significant contribution to stormwater reduction and peak attenuation. For both of the case study sites however it was seen to be necessary to consider the wider catchment area due to the presence of historic watercourses and topographical features.","Invasive exotic insects can cause substantial damage to trees and the environment, and may reduce biodiversity. They can have a large negative economic effect on the forest industry, urban amenity trees and numerous other sectors, and they may necessitate extensive management expenditures. For such high-impact invaders, eradication is desirable but also difficult and often highly controversial. It requires substantial input of resources and commitment from managers and stakeholders, including the general public. Appropriate tools for surveillance and control of the target species must be available if success is to be achieved. This review outlines the sequence of steps required in well-managed operations; examines characteristics of successful and unsuccessful eradication campaigns; describes methods and tools known to be effective against specific pests; and discusses the analysis of costs and benefits of eradication programmes. Feasibility of eradication is increased by early detection, which is facilitated by systematic surveillance. A strong positive relationship exists between size of the affected geographical area and the cost of eradication. Treatment costs for large populations may be prohibitive. Five recent campaigns against lepidopteran species in New Zealand have provided substantial economic benefits, despite the fact that various non-market values were not considered. Although progress has been made in the development, utilisation and integration of eradication tools, some insects are still not amenable to treatment. There is a need for new methods shown to have a minimal effect on other organisms, including human beings. Public attitudes to eradication programmes must always be taken into account during planning and deployment.","We used X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to compare the heavy metal chemistry of sediments in caves in rural and urban areas to the chemistry of sediments from a control cave in a relatively undisturbed watershed in the Springfield (MO) Plateau. Sediment from Smallin Cave near Ozark, MO, the control cave, has the smallest peak sizes for Zn and Mn and a moderately-sized Pb peak. Sediment from the rural cave exhibited larger peaks of Zn and Mn and a smaller Pb peak. Sediment from the urban cave had the largest Zn, Mn and Pb peaks. Interestingly, smaller peak sizes appear to correlate to the presence of aquatic troglobites. The control cave hosts the most diverse troglobitic fauna and has sediment with smaller peak sizes. Ruark caves are rural caves, and are barren of troglobites and have sediment with larger peak sizes. Giboney Cave, an urban cave in Doling Park in Springfield, MO, provides the most interesting evidence. Giboney Cave splits into two branches, each of which has a unique chemical fingerprint. One channel is barren of cave life and has sediment that exhibits large metal peaks. The second channel hosts aquatic troglobites and has sediment that has small metal peaks. These findings are of particular importance because the caves of the Springfield Plateau host abundant troglobitic species, including the endangered Ozarks cavefish (Amblyopsis rosae). Sediment metal concentrations may indicate which cave systems are capable of supporting life, with XRF analysis providing a non-destructive, rapid way to identify such systems.","A dequate information about the existing landscape and about the nature of places that it is desirable to create and to experiment, can no longer be the result of superficial approaches based exclusively on designers and planners' ideas. Even if, planning and monitoring programs frequently use remote sensing data, focusing on changes in land cover and land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, land capability and recreation, they often neglect landscape aesthetics and culture. Aesthetics, a concept developed by the western civilization, has been a subject of debate for philosophers and artists, from the time of the ancient Greece, and more recently for architects, urban and environmental managers and even policy makers. In the present study a quantitative l andscape assessment method was used in order to estimate visual impact, landscape quality, landscape fragility and visual absorption capability of a planned golf course which will be implemented in a forest landscape in the Algarve. The Study area is an enclosed, meadow, riverside landscape in Loule, Portugal. Numerical values were used to assign factors such slope, vegetation observation distance, visual magnitude and human activities in order to analyze, evaluate and characterize the landscape. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used in order to understand and manage the visual resources and to mitigate the visual impacts that may arrise from the implemetation of the proposed golf course development.","Summary \n \n \n1 \nThe species diversity of adjacent landscapes influences the conservation or restoration of several animal groups in urban areas, but the effect on birds is unclear. To address this question, we compared bird species richness (BSR) and community composition between periurban (area surrounding the town) and urban (suburban and centre areas) landscapes across three spatial scales. \n \n2 \nAt a large biogeographical scale (temperate and boreal climatic zone), relationships between the BSR of urban areas and their surrounding landscapes were examined in a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. In general, BSR was negatively correlated with latitude and urbanization. The BSR of suburban and centre landscapes correlated positively with the BSR of periurban landscapes. However, latitudinal effects were also involved, as BSR in urban and periurban landscapes declined as town latitude increased. Similarity indices were low (50%) between periurban and centre bird communities. \n \n3 \nAt a regional scale, we assessed winter bird data from several towns within three regions of temperate and boreal countries (western France, northern Finland and eastern Canada). The type of periurban landscape, number of inhabitants and town diameter did not affect BSR. BSR was similar between the cities of a given biogeographical area. Bird communities were more similar between similar habitat types of different cities than between different habitats of the same city. \n \n4 \nAt a local scale, we tested the influence of proximity to the periurban landscape on BSR in parks of western French towns of different size. Neither BSR nor community similarity changed in relation to the distance of the park from the periurban landscape. \n \n5 \nGuild composition according to diet and feeding habitat did not vary between urban and periurban locations at regional or local scales. \n \n6 \nWe conclude that, at regional and local scales, urban bird communities are independent of the bird diversity of adjacent landscapes, and that local features are more important than surrounding landscapes in determining BSR. Whatever the biodiversity quality of the periurban landscape, site-specific actions such as shrub and tree planting, water restoration and increasing vegetation diversity can change bird diversity in towns and improve the quality of human–wildlife contacts.","The world is struggling against extreme droughts, heavy rain, and heat waves because of climate change. These abnormal climate cause urban flood, urban heat island, and water pollution and shortage and these natural disasters not only threaten citizen’s health and amenity but also negatively affect cities economically, environmentally, and socially. Thus, this paper discusses about green infrastructure as the water sensitive urban design strategy in terms of sustainable stormwater management in the era of climate change. To do this, this paper reviews concept, context, and current trends of green infrastructure as water sensitive urban design strategy and this paper examines relations between green infrastructure and sustainable stormwater management. And then this paper analyzes various case studies on green infrastructure as water sensitive urban design strategy for sustainable stromwater management, which are categorized by city-scale's case studies such as Kallang River Bishan Park and Tanner Springs Park, site and building-scale's case studies such as Mount Tabor School rain garden, Sidwell Friends School wetlands, and California Academy of Sciences green roof, and street-scale's case studies such as NE Siskiyou Green Street, SW 12th Avenue Green Street, and Taylor 28 Green Street. After analyzing these various case studies of green infrastructure as water sensitive urban design strategy, this paper draws water sensitive urban design strategies for sustainable stormwater management. The result of analysis is as follows. Firstly, water sensitive urban design strategy for sustainable stormwater management contains various green infrastructure elements such as urabn wetlands, stormwater parks, eco-streams, green roofs, rain gardens, bio-swales, buffer strips, stormwater planters, permeable pavings, and cisterns. Secondly, these various green infrastructure elements could be applied on the various types of land-use such as buildings, roofs, roads, streets, and parking lots as well as green and water space in urban areas. Thirdly, these multi-dimensional green infrastructure could evaporate, infiltrate, filtrate, and reuse stormwater ecologically through vegetation, soil, and minerals which is applied on green infrastructure. Fourth, these biological green infrastructure could be linked and connected each other to supply more environmental benefits such as urban flood prevention, water purification, and habitat supply for plants and animals than to be applied alone on the various types of land-use. Eventually, these water sensitive urban design strategies as green infrastructure could restore ecologically urban hydrological cycle which is distorted by indiscriminate urban development and could enhance urban biodiversity which is destroyed by massive urban sprawl.","Urban biodiversity provides environmental, social and economic benefits, and consequently \ncontributes to the health and well-being of people living and working in cities. However, a \ncritical review of people-nature literature revealed no integrated theoretical framework linking \nbiodiversity and health. The aim of this thesis is to provide such a framework by developing a \ngrounded theory based on a case study combining a critical literature review and desk study, \nwith ecological and anthropological methods. The study was conducted in Birchwood, \nWarrington, UK, between October 2002 and December 2005. Innovatively, this research used \nsubstitute measures for urban biodiversity and human health and well-being: urban habitat \nstructural diversity, and peoples' activities and experiences, respectively. The former was \nrecorded through an index of urban habitat vegetation structure, Tandy's Isovist technique and \nDomin scale of vegetation cover estimates. Structured observations, opportunistic photograph \ntaking, and content analysis of local archives were employed to evaluate the latter. Non- \nparametric correlations (Kendal's tau_b) revealed that low trees were associated with bird \nwatching (+ 0.421, p=0.05) and leisure walking (+0.336, p= 0.05), and that amenity grassland \nwas associated with jogging (+0.386, p= 0.05) and cycling for leisure (+0.348, p= 0.05). Local \nexperiences were classified into thematic categories with the most frequently expressed \nconcerns being related to 'local community' (39%, N= 1334) and 'open space' (31%, N= \n1334). These empirical data were combined with published theoretical models into an \nintegrative theoretical framework summarised by the grounded theory: local culture is a \nfundamental factor in biodiversity's contribution to human health and well-being. \nConsequently, to maximize mutual benefits, both urban nature conservation and public health \nagencies should jointly develop community engagement programmes. Further \ninterdisciplinary work involving urban nature conservation, public health, landscape \narchitecture and environmental psychology, which can be guided by the integrative framework \ndeveloped in this thesis, is required.","1.

Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. ATM surfaces, potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on ATM keypads in different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the growing body of work focused on the “urban microbiome.” In New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of the island itself. We have only just begun to describe the vast array of microbial taxa that are likely to be present across diverse types of urban habitats. ABSTRACT In densely populated urban environments, the distribution of microbes and the drivers of microbial community assemblages are not well understood. In sprawling metropolitan habitats, the “urban microbiome” may represent a mix of human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of automated teller machine (ATM) keypads in New York City (NYC). Our goal was to describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial assemblages on ATM keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina MiSeq datasets for bacterial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the QIIME pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age groups) from the NYC Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S rRNA datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on ATM keypads were dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although SourceTracker analysis was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that ATM keypads amalgamate microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. DNA obtained from ATM keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes. IMPORTANCE Automated teller machine (ATM) keypads represent a specific and unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings.

However, trace concentrations of organic wastewater-associated contaminants may still pose a key environmental hazard impairing the ecological quality of surface waters. To identify key impact factors, we analyzed the effects of a wide range of anthropogenic and environmental variables on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. We assessed ecological water quality at 26 sampling sites in four urban German lowland river systems with a 0–100% load of state-of-the-art biological activated sludge treated wastewater. The chemical analysis suite comprised 12 organic contaminants (five phosphor organic flame retardants, two musk fragrances, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, octylphenol, diethyltoluamide, terbutryn), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 12 heavy metals. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified organic contaminants that are mainly wastewater-associated (i.e., phosphor organic flame retardants, musk fragrances, and diethyltoluamide) as a major impact variable on macroinvertebrate species composition. The structural degradation of streams was also identified as a significant factor. Multiple linear regression models revealed a significant impact of organic contaminants on invertebrate populations, in particular on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species. Spearman rank correlation analyses confirmed wastewater-associated organic contaminants as the most significant variable negatively impacting the biodiversity of sensitive macroinvertebrate species. In addition to increased aquatic pollution with organic contaminants, a greater wastewater fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in salinity. This study highlights the importance of reducing the wastewater-associated impact on surface waters. For aquatic ecosystems in urban areas this would lead to: (i) improvement of the ecological integrity, (ii) reduction of biodiversity loss, and (iii) faster achievement of objectives of legislative requirements, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.","...................................................v CASE STUDY: SILICON VALLEY 3 4URBAN BIODIVERSITY PLANNING LOOKING FORWARD 5 A FRAMEWORK FOR BIODIVERSITY ENHANCEMENT IN CITIES 2 ..........................16 ..........................58 ..........................108 ..........................126 The Urban Biodiversity Framework is part of the Healthy Watersheds, Resilient Baylands project, which is funded by a grant to the San Francisco Estuary Partnership from the San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund of the US Environmental Protection Agency Region IX.

The impacts of global climate change are felt locally, and thus local governance structures will increasingly be responsible for preparedness and local responses. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) options are gaining prominence as relevant climate change solutions. Local government officials seldom have an appropriate understanding of the role of ecosystem functioning in sustainable development goals, or access to relevant climate information. Thus the use of ecosystems in helping people adapt to climate change is limited partially by the lack of information on where ecosystems have the highest potential to do so. To begin overcoming this barrier, Conservation South Africa in partnership with local government developed a socio-ecological approach for identifying spatial EbA priorities at the sub-national level. Using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and vegetation distribution models, the authors have spatially integrated relevant ecological and social information at a scale appropriate to inform local level political, administrative, and operational decision makers. This is the first systematic approach of which we are aware that highlights spatial priority areas for EbA implementation. Nodes of socio-ecological vulnerability are identified, and the inclusion of areas that provide ecosystem services and ecological resilience to future climate change is innovative. The purpose of this paper is to present and demonstrate a methodology for combining complex information into user-friendly spatial products for local level decision making on EbA. The authors focus on illustrating the kinds of products that can be generated from combining information in the suggested ways, and do not discuss the nuance of climate models nor present specific technical details of the model outputs here. Two representative case studies from rural South Africa demonstrate the replicability of this approach in rural and peri-urban areas of other developing and least developed countries around the world.","The use of scenarios to evaluate restoration effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) is fundamental to improve restoration practices. Here we developed a systematic review to verify the existence of gaps and limitations in the use of scenarios for environmental restoration, and assess the state of the science of “restoration scenarios” and implications for future research. From 419 studies reviewed, most were held in developed countries, using exploratory scenarios at the regional scale, actively restoring ES and habitat at “habitat, ecosystems or communities” at landscape level, targeting forests and fragmented landscapes. The main gaps we identified were: few studies in tropical, marine, and urban environments, despite their importance for biodiversity and ES; few reports on global scales using target‐seeking approach, despite the existence of global targets; small number of studies considered invertebrates and invasive species, neglecting many ecosystem services and disservices; lack of participatory and cost‐effectiveness studies, revealing a disconnection between restoration research and socioeconomic context. The gaps identified might prevent the widespread use of scenarios for restoration planning, particularly the limited scales of analysis, the lack of participatory approaches, and weak cost consideration. We encourage the use of target‐seeking scenarios, with clear objectives, stimulating collaboration among stakeholders seeking cost‐effective restoration alternatives.","This paper discusses soil metal interactions with microbial diversity and the potential implications for soil productivity and animal and human health. Sources and fate of metal ions in the soil environment, biological interactions and transitions, as well as adverse impacts on soil biodiversity, toxicity. The present works deals the analysis of heavy metals by electrochemical sensors and its effect on microbial communities. For this purpose a no. of bacteria were isolated and the heavy metals of Cu++, Cd++ and Zn++ tolerance in bacteria were studied. It was found that bacteria were highly sensitive to Cu++ compared to Cd++ and Zn++ metals. These finding suggested that the potential of bacteria in developing a electrochemical sensor to analyze Cu++ in soil sample. Heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, chromium and mercury, are important environmental pollutants particularly in area with high anthropogenic pressure. Heavy metals present in soil cause serious problems to all organisms. Heavy metals are often defined1-2 as a group of metals where atomic density is greater than 5 g/cm3. Metals play a vital role in the metabolic processes of the biota. Some of the heavy metals are essential and required by the organisms as micronutrients (Cobalt, chromium, nickel, iron, manganese and zinc etc.) and are known as trace element3. On the other hand some other heavy metals have no biological role and determination to the organisms even at very low concentration (Cd, Hg, Pb etc.). However at high level both of the essential and non-essential metals become toxic to any organism. These heavy metals influence the microbial population by affecting their growth, morphology, biochemical activities and diversity4. Toxicity of these heavy metals occurs through the displacement of essential metals from their native binding sites or through ligand interaction. The more localized metal contamination found in urban environments. In Heavy metals a few as Cu (II,) Zn (II,) Cd (II) &amp; Pb (II) arise from number of industrial, mining and agricultural activities. Copper phyto toxicity in soil is difficult to access because copper accumulates and damages roots. Soil chemical properties strongly influence Cu Specification. Usually soil contains 2-100 PPM, overage concentration of Cu is 09 PPM Copper toxicity is uncommon but can occur when soil are contamination with high copper materials5. Due to the Selective pressure from the metal in the growth environment, microorganisms have evolved various mechanisms to resist the heavy metal Stress6. This has become a threat to public health and microbial community. Cadmium, Copper and Zinc are among those heavy metals that are being released to environment7. In this perspective many approaches have been used to asses the risk posed by the contamination metals in soil, water bodies etc. For this purpose in present work Electro chemical sensor were developed for the assessment of heavy metal such as copper in soil and their important microbes (Bacteria). Copper Electro chemical sensor found very wide application in. environmental sample Electro chemical sensor is cost effective than other8-10. By the use of these Electro chemical Sensor, concentration of copper present in soil were determined. After that effect of these heavy metal a (Copper, Cadmium, lead etc.) toxicity is determined on the soil bacteria. In present work the tolerance of soil bacteria to heavy metal has been proposed as an indicator of the potential toxicity of heavy metals to other forms of biota11,12 . The objective of this work is to develop tool to asses the heavy metal level in the soil, and their impact an bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS (A) Development of Electrochemical Sensor: Several different electrochemical sensors have already been developed to asses the heavy metals like. Copper, cadmium and Zinc. In the present work membrane based copper, cadmium and Zinc Electrochemical sensor were prepared. For this purpose copper Sulphide, Cadmium-Thiobarbutarate and Zinc Urate were used as a Electro active material for the prepration of Electro active membrane. Electrochemical Sensor consists of a membrane in which electro active materials are impregnated. These membranes based Electrochemical Sensor selective electrode were employed successfully for preperation of heavy metal Electrochemical sensor. These electrode have good reversion response","The study was conducted in Brazzaville, and data collection covers the period from May to June 2017. The methodology is based on literature review and floristic and equipment inventory. Nine green spaces spread over two out of nine townships in the capital city. Four are located in Bacongo and five in Poto-Poto. According to the classification standards, 5 squares and 4 gardens were studied. Except for one square, all the others, including the gardens, are planted with trees. The equipment inventory lists 183 benches, including 63.83% permanently and/or partially in the sun, 4 playgrounds, no games for children, and 3 cultural monuments. The flora and health of the trees stands shows 186 trees and 279 shrubs, all corresponding to 26 species. An examination of the health status reveals that 57% of trees show anthropogenic injuries. Floral analysis shows that exotic plants (76.92%) predominate over local plants (23.07%). The average basal area of trees in all green spaces is 1.95 m2·ha−1. The diametric structure is erratic within all green spaces, with a dominance of large diameter subjects. This leads to poor natural regeneration of woody plants. The green spaces in Brazzaville, which are very unevenly distributed within the urban fabric, do not meet the international standards disseminated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and do not fully play their biodiversity conservation and recreational and ecological functions. History of green spaces in Brazzaville states that no creation was born after independence. The existing land has been reduced in size, and the new land has been used for other purposes.","Being invisible to the naked eye, microbes managed to escape scientific scrutiny until the mid-17th century, when Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope. These cryptic organisms continued to thwart scientists' efforts to probe, describe, and classify them until about 40 years ago, owing largely to a limited morphology that defies traditional taxonomic methods and an enigmatic physiology that makes them notoriously difficult to cultivate. \n \nMost of what we know about the biochemical diversity of microbes comes from the tiny fraction that submit to lab investigations. Not until scientists determined that they could use molecular sequences to identify species and determine their evolutionary heritage, or phylogeny, did it begin to become apparent just how diverse microbes are. We now know that microbes are the most widely distributed organisms on earth, having adapted to environments as diverse as boiling sulfur pits and the human gut. Accounting for half of the world's biomass, microbes provide essential ecosystem services by cycling the mineral nutrients that support life on earth. And marine microbes remove so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that some scientists see them as a potential solution to global warming. \n \nYet even as scientists describe seemingly endless variations on the cosmopolitan microbial lifestyle, the concept of a bacterial species remains elusive. Some bacterial species (such as anthrax) appear to have little genetic variation while in others (such as Escherichia coli) individuals can have completely different sets of genes, challenging scientists to explain the observed diversity. \n \nThe emerging field of environmental genomics (or metagenomics) aims to capture the full measure of microbial diversity by trading the lens of the microscope (and biochemistry) for the lens of genomics (and bioinformatics). By recovering communities of microbial genes where they live, environmental genomics avoids the need to culture uncooperative organisms. And by linking these data to details relating to sequence collection sites, such as pH, salinity, and water temperature, it sheds light on the biological processes encoded in the genes. \n \nThe largest metagenomic dataset collected so far comes from the Sorcerer II expedition, named after the yacht J. Craig Venter transformed into a marine research vessel. In a pilot study of the Sargasso Sea, Venter's team identified 1.2 million genes and inferred the presence of at least 1,800 bacterial species. But the genetic and taxonomic diversity of the data imposed new challenges on existing genome assembly methods and other analysis techniques. The researchers designed the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition to see if collecting more samples would improve their assembly and lead to a better estimate of the number and diversity of microbial genes in the oceans. \n \nAnd now, in three new studies, Venter's team has combined the expedition's latest bounty—6.5 million sequencing “reads”—with the Sargasso Sea data. The result is a geographically diverse environmental genomic dataset of 6.3 billion base pairs—twice the size of the human genome. (To learn about the voyage and sampling methods, see Box 1.) In the first paper, Douglas Rusch, Aaron Halpern, and colleagues attempt to describe the immense amount of microbial diversity in the seas, and determine how—or if—that diversity is structured and what might be shaping that structure. In the second paper, Shibu Yooseph et al. study the millions of proteins in the GOS sequences to see if we're close to discovering all the proteins in nature. And in the third study, Natarajan Kannan, Gerard Manning, and colleagues classify thousands of kinases into 20 distinct families, revealing their structural and functional diversity and an unexpected importance in prokaryotic regulation. \n \n \nBox 1. Following the Sorcerer II's Hunt for Microbes \nThe Sorcerer II expedition was inspired by the British Challenger expedition (1872–1876), a pioneering oceanography research project that discovered hundreds of new genera and nearly 5,000 new marine species. Its gun stations replaced with research stations, the Challenger circumnavigated the oceans, stopping every 320 kilometers to recover specimens from bottom, intermediate, and surface depths to explore the diversity of macroscopic marine life. At each stop, the crew recorded the location, what they used to extract the sample, the depth of the sample, and several observations related to water and atmospheric conditions. The Sorcerer II followed a similar sampling schedule, traveling nearly 9,000 kilometers to collect samples of microbial marine life and record the water's location, depth, pH, salinity, and temperature. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH.M.S. Challenger (Image: NOAA, Steve Nicklas) \n \n \n \nThe GOS crew collected samples from surface waters of diverse, mostly marine aquatic environments. The samples were collected between August 2003 and May 2004 during a six-leg journey that followed a path from northeastern Canada to the South Pacific Gyre. Venter's crew collected microbial samples by pumping 200 liters of surface seawater through a series of increasingly fine filters, which they labeled, froze, and sent back to the lab of the J. Craig Venter Institute in Maryland. \n \nAfter a stop in the Gulf of Maine, the expedition sampled three sites along Nova Scotia, including a “highly eutrophic” coastal embayment in Halifax. The crew set sail again in November, starting in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, and ending in the Delaware Bay, one of several estuaries targeted on the journey. \n \nThe next leg began in Chesapeake Bay. The largest US estuary, Chesapeake Bay contains a rich mix of freshwater and marine organisms. Estuaries are complex hydrodynamic environments that are highly sensitive to runoff from agricultural and urban development (which can dump massive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous into watersheds). Microbial communities collected from estuaries promise to provide valuable insights into the metabolic and physiological adaptations required by such environments. Continuing down the Atlantic seaboard, the expedition stopped near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and the Florida Keys before passing through the Caribbean and ending near Panama, where the crew collaborated with scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. \n \nThe fourth leg of the voyage sampled sites in the Eastern Pacific, including Cocos Island, about 500 kilometers southwest of Costa Rica. A highly productive ecosystem inhabits the waters off the island, a result of ocean currents buffeting the coast and causing nutrient upwellings that mix with warm surface waters. The crew made one last stop in the open ocean, then headed for the Galapagos Islands. \n \nOwing in part to its position near major ocean currents and atmospheric transition zones, the Galapagos Archipelago sits within a hydrographically complex region. Unique oceanographic features there support a diverse set of habitats and endemic species, found within several discrete zones distinguished by temperature. This microbial mother lode held the crew's attention for two months, while they extensively sampled the region. \n \n \nBy early March 2004, the crew had collected the last three samples used in these studies, from two open ocean sites and a lagoon in a coral reef in the South Pacific Gyre.

Craig Venter Institute)","This review paper focuses on research schemes regarding urbanity and urbanization, and brings together both cultural and physical approaches. First, we review the cultural and social construction of urbanity (as related to urbanization) in Germany. In the early 20th century, urbanity was mainly the result of identity derived from a historical perspective in cities. This has changed profoundly in recent decades as urbanity stems more and more from various urban lifestyles and the staging of societal experiences, as summarized in the German term, “Erlebnisgesellschaft” (thrill-seeking society). The discussion is extended by an assessment of the recent state of the art regarding physical urban research. The focus lies on different fields of research; we address topics such as biodiversity, urban climate, air pollution, and resilience, as well as their impact on urban planning and governance. In conclusion, in order to tackle recent developments and future challenges regarding social and environmental issues, an integrative approach urges novel cross- and inter-disciplinary research efforts in urban studies, including urban-rural linkages. A newly constituted assessment of urbanization and city quarter development is proposed; the assessment focuses on the conjoint analysis of mobility, “Energiewende” (energy transition), cultural drivers, demographic development, and environmental issues.","We live in an increasingly urban world that puts an unprecedented pressure on ecosystems. This trend presents an urgent challenge in terms of conservation of the biodiversity and many of the ecosystem services on which society depends. Unfortunately, the importance of biodiversity and the benefits we get from it do not represent an immediate concern for the approximately 900 million people living in slums without basic services, poor housing and unsanitary living conditions. This review attempts to tackle the question of how to integrate urban biodiversity into slums contexts through a comparative analysis of cities, the study of planning tools and criteria and the proposal of local actions for biodiversity in informal settlements. These actions are composed by a toolkit that presents, the territorial and social convergence through successful examples of integrating the challenges of poverty and degradation of our ecosystems.","The recently approved OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) specification defines a generic interface for providing geo-processing functionality in a standardized way. Web Services in general can be composed in service chains for carrying out more complex tasks. This paper presents an approach for offering a chaining tool for WPS processes in a simple as possible way. Basic functionalities can be combined in extensive workflows without touching any source code, just by creating a XML file according to our developed XML schema. A proof of concept is given by applying the developed implementation in a use case of disaster management for urban areas. In conclusion our implementation makes it easy for any GIS user to provide new complex processes by our developed framework. 2 THE OGC WPS INTERFACE The WPS standard is quite open and such a service may provide simple calculations (e.g. the calculation of a buffer) as well as complex computations (e.g. the generation of a climate model). Thus, in principle there are no restrictions on what can be implemented using the WPS interface. There are three mandatory operations that must be performed by a WPS, namely GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess and Execute. When a GetCapabilities request is made to the WPS, it must send back an XML document describing the service capabilities. This XML response must contain metadata about the service itself and the processes it provides. When a DescribeProcess request is made to the WPS, it must reply sending back an XML document describing one or more of the available web processes in detail. The document must specify the input parameters and formats for executing a specific process and the output format of the process result. Finally the process is executed when an Execute request is sent to the service. As the specification allows any kind of geoprocessing functionality it can be applied to a wide variety of domains and tasks. Some examples include disaster management (Stollberg &amp; Zipf 2007), forest fire analysis (Friis-Christensen et al. 2007), generalization (Foerster &amp; Stoter 2006), hydrological models (Diaz et al. 2008), housing market analysis (Stollberg &amp; Zipf 2008), biodiversity research (Graul &amp; Zipf 2008), time series analysis (Gerlach et al. 2008), precision farming (Nash et al. 2008) etc. 3 WEB SERVICE ORCHESTRATION An established standard concerning Web Service Orchestration (WSO) is the use of the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) which uses the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). WSDL is a standard for the description of a Web Service interface and acts as the link between the Orchestration Engine (OE) and the services involved. The WSDL interface offers the possibility of providing a defined functionality for a client where the underlying implementation is not transparent. As the WPS standard defines the service itself but not the underlying processes provided by the implementation this means in consequence that there is no predefined WSDL description for a WPS. Rather a process developer is forced to define a WSDL description of each process together with a definition of the DescribeProcess document. In the case of a provided WSDL document for a WPS process it is then possible to address this process by means of BPEL and integrate it within a chain of services. This implies that an Orchestration Engine is set up which is able to execute the chain in turn. BPEL and WSDL are mainstream IT standards and not yet well established within the Geographic Information (GI) community. The use of these standards is at the moment burdened with a lot of overhead (defining WSDL documents by hand, setting up and using an OE). For this reason we developed another approach by simple means for the easy chaining of WPS processes within the GI community. 4 DEVELOPMENT OF A SERVICE CHAIN SCHEMA The idea behind our approach is the development of a simple XML schema defining a service chain. Such a service chain can then be presented according to the schema by a single XML document. This document in turn can be interpreted by a suitable implementation which is able to parse it and execute the involved processes in the defined order. For the development of such a schema we made the considerations listed in the following section. It has to be pointed out that a WPS instance is able to provide several processes. For this reason a single service within a chain is synonymous to a WPS process. This means any service equates with any process of any WPS instance. In the following we are speaking of services for simplifying matters. The following considerations were made: − Each service chain consists of several services − Each service has a web address (WPS Server) and an identifier (as a WPS can provide more than a single process) − Each service needs a unique identifier within the service chain − Each service defines any number of inputs and outputs − Each input and output of a service has an identifier − Each input of a service can be a predefined literal value, a predefined web-accessible resource providing complex spatial data (e.g. the address of a Web Feature Service (WFS) layer), a value which is passed within the service chain request or the output of a previously executed service within the chain (in this case the unique identifier of this service in the chain is required besides the corresponding identifier of the output of this service) − The complete service chain consists of any number of outputs − Each output of the service chain has an identifier − Each output of the service chain is the output of a specific executed service within the chain and can be defined by the unique identifier of this service and the identifier of the output of this service Figure 1. The element Service within the developed ServiceChain schema. Figure 2. The element Input within the developed schema. Figure 3. The element OutputServiceChain within the developed schema. 5 EXAMPLE SERVICE CHAIN IN A DISASTERMANAGEMENT USE CASE The WPS ServiceChain implementation can be used in a wide area of applications and independent from a specific domain. Any functionality which is available as a WPS process (on any server instance) can be integrated into a more complex workflow. For proving our concept, we want to give an example in the field of disaster management in urban areas. Apart from this example application we want to emphasize that the concept is not confined to a specific theme but applicable in a wide range of domains. In our use case we assume that a gas leakage was detected in a densely populated area. The toxic gas, which is a threat to human beings, is spreading. Furthermore we assume that there is a shared network of gauging stations available which provides measured values of air pollution within this area. The user in our scenario might be a staff member of the disaster management department of the affected city. He has to initiate further actions and has to answer three specific questions for this purpose: − Are there any gauging stations providing real-time information about air pollution close to the location of the leakage? − Approximately how many people have to be evacuated close to the location of the leakage? − Are there any evacuation shelters close to the affected area where the evacuees can be safely assembled together? All three questions imply several GIS operations and each can be provided as a new complex process. For answering the first question of close-by gauging stations two steps have to be executed. In the first step a buffer operation around the gas leakage location is carried out. This is followed by a polygon-contains-point analysis as a second step. Thereby the result of the first operation presents the input for the second operation within the workflow. The scenario is illustrated in figure 4. The complex process described above can be expressed by means of our ServiceChain schema as presented in figure 5. Figure 4. Finding gauging stations within a specific buffer around a gas leakage location. Figure 5. Service Chain example of finding gauging stations within a specific buffer by means of a XML document according to our developed schema. The complex process consists of two services: Service1 is defined in lines 5-9 within the XML document depicted in figure 5 and Service2 is defined in lines 10-14. Service1 takes two input parameters, namely the InputGeometry which is in our scenario the location of the gas leakage and secondly the desired BufferDistance. Both input parameter will be part of the request which has so be sent in order to execute the complex process. Furthermore Service1 creates one output, namely the BufferedGeometry. Service2 takes again two input parameters, namely PolygonFeatures which is in our scenario the buffered gas leakage location and respectively the output of Service1. For this reason the input parameter is set as ProcessedData. The second input parameter of Service2 is PointFeatures. This is a dataset of all available gauging stations of the city. Furthermore Service2 has one output called JoinedFeatures. These JoinedFeatures, which are the gauging stations located within the buffer of the gas leakage, are also the desired output for the complete complex process. This is expressed within the XML tag OutputServiceChain. After deploying this complex process by means of our developed ServiceChain schema the new WPS process is available within our framework and the user is able to execute the process at any time with the relevant input parameters (gas leakage location, width of the buffer to calculate, location of the gauging stations dataset). It is now not necessary anymore for the user to execute the two separate processes one after another but he has the ability to carry out both steps within one operation. The result is a number of gauging stations within the specified buffer around the gas leakage location. These stations might deliver real-time data about air pollution and give informat","provided valuable feedback on previous versions of this report.

The mission of the Green Visions Plan for 21st Century Southern California is to offer a guide to habitat conservation, watershed health and recreational open space for the Los Angeles metropolitan region. The Plan will also provide decision support tools to nurture a living green matrix for southern California. Our goals are to protect and restore natural areas, restore natural hydrological function, promote equitable access to open space, and maximize support via multiple-use facilities. The Plan is a joint venture between the The Los Angeles region presents a dilemma for conservation planners. The least disturbed natural lands are found in the mountain ranges that ring and bisect the metropolitan area while the most disturbed lands are found in the flat plains of the valleys. Based on the current distribution of parklands, the mountains and foothills have historically received significant conservation attention, while the rivers and plains of the valleys have not. As the culmination of a variety of influences, greater emphasis is now placed on the valleys and plains. This emphasis has evolved out of a desire to reclaim rivers as a part of public space, an increasing need to undertake watershed planning to meet regional water quality goals, and identification of a need for access to open space. This report identifies the various strategies that make up a well-rounded approach to urban conservation to benefit biodiversity and analyzes a set of projects proposed for the upper Los Angeles River watershed for fulfillment of these strategies. I concentrate on a single aspect of urban conservation, the protection of native biodiversity. This report begins with a series of reviews to illustrate the mix of strategies necessary for an urban conservation program to maximize native biodiversity. Multiple approaches are necessary because not all species are distributed in the same manner spatially, and they respond to the urban environment in different ways. A strategy to preserve bobcats may not be effective at maintaining diversity of dragonflies. Based on this review of strategies, I identify the approaches that would be appropriate …","Tracking land surface dynamics over cloud prone areas with complex mountainous terrain is an important challenge facing the Earth Science community. One such region is the Lake Kivu region in Central Africa. We developed a processing chain to systematically monitor the spatio-temporal land use/land cover dynamics of this region over the years 1988, 2001, and 2011 using Landsat data, complemented by ancillary data. Topographic compensation was performed on Landsat reflectances to avoid the strong illumination angle impacts and image compositing was used to compensate for frequent cloud cover and thus incomplete annual data availability in the archive. A systematic supervised classification was applied to the composite Landsat imagery to obtain land cover thematic maps with overall accuracies of 90% and higher. Subsequent change analysis between these years found extensive conversions of the natural environment as a result of human related activities. The gross forest cover loss for 1988–2001 and 2001–2011 period was 216.4 and 130.5 thousand hectares, respectively, signifying significant deforestation in the period of civil war and a relatively stable and lower deforestation rate later, possibly due to conservation and reforestation efforts in the region. The other dominant land cover changes in the region were aggressive subsistence farming and urban expansion displacing natural vegetation and arable lands. Despite limited data availability, this study fills the gap of much needed detailed and updated land cover change information for this biologically important region of Central Africa. These multi-temporal datasets will be a valuable baseline for land use managers in the region interested in developing ecologically sustainable land management strategies and measuring the impacts of biodiversity conservation efforts.","Background: Indian sub-continent has not only wealthy landscapes environment to support huge population, but also has big challenging problems of vector borne disease epidemics across the country. India has become host for all kinds of virus of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and JE, and also endemic host for filariasis parasites. The integrated hybrid techniques of remote sensing, GPS, and GIS are used to map the spatial variation of the vector biodiversity, vector abundance, and the active infection state of vector borne disease transmission, and surveillance towards the epidemic control and management. Materials and Methods: The Indian IRS satellite data was used to mapping the use/ land cover of metropolitan study area, and was used to mapping of Malaria and JE Vector Mosquito Breeding Habitats. The mosquito potential breeding surface of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, JE and filariasis was calculated for the each ward and which was mapped with graduated colors. The Arc View 3.2, Arc View Spatial analysis and Arc View image analyst, GIS software used to create a systematic grid sampling method for conducting the reconnaissance survey and mapping mosquito breeding surface maps. GARMIN 12XL GPS was used to collect the mosquito reconnaissance survey for mosquito vectors in the city. Result and Discussion: The total potential breeding surfaces of malaria, filariasis and JE were measured in square kilo meters (sq.km), the habitats positive for dengue and chikungunya vector mosquitoes breeding was calculated in percentage for mapping and the ward wise cumulative value of mosquitoes potential breeding was also estimated for mapping the areas vulnerable for mosquito problems and the extensive of vector mosquito borne disease transmissions. The mosquito’s problem was highly associated with population density and the number of houses, households, and perhaps, it was spatially good agreement with ground water tables. A systematic grid sampling was applied to conduct a rapid survey for mapping Aedes species mosquitogenic condition in the urban areas and the site coordinates of houses information with breeding habitats positive in the grid sectors was collected using GPS. The virtual GPS under the GIS umbrella was used to conduct a rapid survey with 0.5km distance interval (grid sampling procedures) for assessing the mosquitogenic condition and for mapping the sectors positives for dengue and chikungunya vector mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti or Ae. albopictus) breeding habitats (water storage vessels, plastic and cement containers, tires, plastic cups, coconut cells, tree holes, flower vessels, fridge, stone grinder, etc.,) with accurate site specifications, and the mean value of positive habitats was analyzed by quintiles method for mapping the ground situation in the urban settlements. Conclusion: It is concluded that remote sensing, GPS, and GIS are effectively useful to identify, delineate and mapping of vector mosquitoes potential breeding surface areas and studying the mosquitogenic conditions in the urban agglomeration, and used to control and management of the vector borne disease transmission, perhaps, may also be GIS based surveillance is the best solution for epidemic control and management of the present situation vector borne disease transmission; especially, malaria and dengue epidemic in the country.","Ecological land is a major supplier of ecosystem services, and plays a key role in controlling regional eco⁃ environmental quality. Protection of ecological land significantly promotes the sustainable development of society, the economy, ecology, and regional ecological security. The present research used Yixing city as a case study area, which is located in the southern part of Jiangsu Province. Firstly, following previous research into the relationships between ecological land use classification and current land use classification, the vector data for ecological land were acquired from the current land use vector data for Yixing. Secondly, the landscape security pattern theory and the model of minimum cumulative resistance were used to construct a comprehensive landscape security pattern after systematic analysis of the soil and water conservation, biodiversity protection, vernacular culture protection, and natural landscape protection processes related to ecological land. The overall landscape was then classified into four grades. Finally, the comprehensive landscape security pattern and the current ecological land maps were overlaid. The current ecological land areas were classified into lower, low, middle, and high security pattern levels, and these areas covered 50528.29 hm, 69942.53 hm, 34777.44 hm and htt p:/ /w ww .ec olo gic a.c n http: / / www.ecologica.cn 2335.07 hm, respectively, which accounted for 32.07%, 44.38%, 22.07%, and 1.48% of the total ecological land area, respectively. In the lower security pattern level ecological land, forest land and cultivated land, located in the southern hilly area, were the priority use types. In the low security pattern level ecological land, cultivated land, and water surrounding the city were the priority use types. In the middle security pattern level ecological land, water and cultivated land that was away from the city were the priority use types, and in the high security pattern level ecological land, water that was located far from the west bank of Taihu Lake was the only land use type. This study makes recommendations for improving ecological land based on the condition of the different land use types found in the ecological land areas. Identifying the landscape security pattern levels for ecological land and giving priority to protecting ecological land are the main approaches used to expand ecological land in urban construction areas in regions that are undergoing accelerated urbanization. This study provides scientific guidance that will aid urban sustainable development decision making, and land use planning and management in Yixing. It also provides scientific methods for ecological land planning that could be used in other areas with similar land conditions.","Review: Conservation Across Borders: Biodiversity in an Interdependent World By Charles C. Chester Reviewed by A.M. Mannion University of Reading, UK Charles C. Chester. Conservation Across Borders: Biodiversity in an Interdependent World. Washington D.C.: Island Press, 2006. 262pp. ISBN: 1-55963-611-4, US pbk Alkaline paper. $US 29.95. Biodiversity loss is one of the major environmental issues of the 21st century. The conservation of species and ecosystems is difficult under the best of circumstances but where regional or national borders are involved the task requires even more effort. In North America, the mainly straightline boundaries separating the USA from Mexico in the south and Canada in the North were drawn with political and not ecological motives. Conservation problems associated with these boundaries are the substance of this book and are illustrated by reference to two initiatives: the International Sonoran Desert Alliance (ISDA) and the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y). Following an introduction to the general problem and the specific programmes, Chester's book moves into an analysis of the many interpretations of the term 'transborder', and a brief review of historical efforts at transborder conservation such as the proposed Peace Parks of the of the early 1900s in Europe and North America. The many international initiatives have various names, the most widely accepted being Transboundary Protected Areas (TBPAs). Their advantages and disadvantages, successes and failures, best and worst practices are examined. A major example discussed is the Man and Biosphere Programme (MAB), established in the late 1960s, which recognized conservation needs and the need to reconcile them with society's needs, and instigated the development of an international network of Biosphere Reserves to preserve representative areas of the world's biodiversity. The goals, ethics and practices of MAB influenced ISDA and Y2Y, both ambitious projects embracing substantial areas, land managers with varying economic and ecological goals as well as different national governments. Details of the ISDA occupy the next 80 pages. Its official designation occurred in 1993 but it emerged from earlier MAB efforts in Mexico and the USA, which emerged from even earlier protected areas. Biology and geography are just two facets of a complex land area that experiences rapid urban growth, cultural variation, different legal systems, migration problems and drug smuggling. ISDA itself has experienced rifts within its ruling body and shifts in policy from an emphasis on land management to environmental education and community outreach programmes. …","To mitigate the biodiversity crisis and human-land conflicts during rapid urbanization,the construction of \"urban forests\" and other ecological landscape has been adopted as a common approach for decades,which emphasizes their role of urban green space as species habitat or recreation sites in densely-populated regions.In the research and planning of urban forests and other ecological landscapes,the landscape connectivity associated with the behaviors of certain species(users) has increasingly attracted attentions.However,there are still many problems unsolved in terms of the modeling and the analysis of behavior-integrating landscape structure,as well as the meaningful ways to parameterize the real \"landscape connectivity\".Based on the blueprint-background transposition idea of negative planning,this paper aims to introduce a new approach to the modeling and the analysis of functional landscape connectivity. Space syntax,a widely accepted principle in the field of architecture and urban planning,has the potentials to facilitate the development of new models on the landscape connectivity integrated with species behaviors.Driven by the theory of space syntax on current stage,this paper introduced the language of artificial intelligence into landscape ecology research,based on the hypothesis that the principle of space syntax still works after replacing the study objects in human settlement with those in ecological landscape.A case study was used to demonstrate the advantages of this new method of studying landscape connectivity. In view of the similarity in spatial configuration between the landscapes inhabited by avian edge species and the objects of axial map study,we used the axial map approach of space syntax to study the landscape connectivity based on the behaviors of avian edge species.Firstly,this paper introduced the traditional connectivity quantification methods and species migration models,summarized their limitations based on literature review,and identified the need of improvements on the individual based models to reflect weighted choice among landscape elements and to predict the messages of interaction between species and landscape in upper scale.Secondly,we put forward the idea of introducing the space syntax model into the field of \"edge species-habitat\" in landscape ecological research,inspired by the idea of negative planning.Finally,as a case study,we applied the axial map approach of space syntax in the planning research of urban forests in Hezhou city,made a primary test on the \"free space\" of landscape inhabited by avian edge species and drew the conclusion on the index of integration and intelligibility accordingly.Simulation results were to demonstrate that the model of axial map in the field of behavior-integrating landscape connectivity could reflect the species′ migration choice among differently-shaped landscape elements,which has different weights in direction and distance,and could predict the multi-scale behaviors of the species based on the messages they perceived in vicinity.","Industrial ecology,eco-efficiency,eco-design,X multiple of revolution are theoretical basis for sustainable development.Among these,eco-efficiency is the most popular method for quantitative analysis.The concept of eco-efficiency was firstly put forward in the academic by Schaltegger and Sturn in the year 1990.Being promoted greatly by the World Business Council for Sustainable,eco-efficiency has obtained great attention in sustainable development research.Claude Fussler firstly introduced the concept of eco-efficiency to China in 1995.There are many achievements in the researches of eco-efficiency in china in recent ten years.Different accounting methods of eco-efficiency in different researching fields were developed,especially in the researches on circular economy in different scales of urban,regional and national level.In this paper,eco-efficiency counting methods and applications in different scales have been sum up based on the review of relevant literature in recent ten years.The accounting methods of eco-efficiency were divided into three categories:(1) Economic/environmental single ratio method.Sometimes,the total production of the product or service,total sales and the total net sales were used to stand for the economic dimension.Resources consumptions,carbon dioxide emissions or other environmental impacts were used to present the environmental dimension.(2) Indicator system method was consisted by indicators which independent from each other but stand for each sections of the research subject.The indicator system method is suit for analyzing the complex systems which contains social,economic and natural subsystems.(3) Modeling method.Data envelopment analysis method is the main method,and other productivity models have been used for eco-efficiency analysis.Then,eco-efficiency could be applied on different scales,such as plant,industry,regional and etc.According to the summarize of current researches,we found that:(1) Researches on eco-efficiency have shifted from simple evaluation to driving mechanism exploring shown in international literatures,but domestic researches still remain in the simple evaluation level.(2) Modeling and methods of eco-efficiency exist in the area of accounting,finance and productivity have been brought to modify and correct the economic/ecological ratio model,while domestic researches focus on building a multi-index system of eco-efficiency,and apply the productivity models for assessment.(3) In the area of eco-efficiency application,international researches showed interests on industrial system and its production system,and applied eco-efficiency method to eco-design and product development.Comparatively,domestic researches mainly focus on the assessment of ecological parks,urban and regional areas,but very few researches in the scale of industrial scale.(4) International researches of eco-efficiency were associated with global ecological issues,such as global warming,biodiversity,food security,while domestic researches focused on analyzing pollutants and wastes.(5) Current studies didn′t explain the roots of ecological and environmental crisis,and the social dimensions were usually not taking into consideration.Finally,the article point out,domestic government should spread the notion of eco-efficiency,propel the researches and applications both in micro and large scale;Improve the eco-efficiency accounting methodology with theories and methods of economy,management,accounting and other disciplines;Use the full array polygon graphical methods to reflect the different aspects of the social-economic-natural complex ecological system.","urban watershed, coastal estuary, eastern deciduous forest, tropical rain forest, tallgrass prairie—these are just a few of the ecosystems represented in the 24 sites of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network (Franklin et al. 1990). By combining information from the diverse ecosystems represented in the LTER network, participants have a unique opportunity for large-scale investigations of complex phenomena like climate change, biodiversity, soil dynamics, and environmental policy. In 1996, to facilitate data exchange and synthesis from its multiple sites, LTER launched the LTER Network Information System (NIS), based on an independent site and central office organizational infrastructure. Other organizational partnerships provide examples of earlier efforts also focused on communications and data sharing: the Worm Community System, the Flora of North America Project (FNAP), and the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). The Worm Community System was developed—before Internet connectivity became available—as a collaborative software environment through which its 1400 widely dispersed researchers could share information on the genetics, behavior, and biology of the soil nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans. Insight into the complexity of a network structure was gained through attention to the design and analysis of both the system’s structure and usability (Star and Ruhleder 1996). The FNAP system, in contrast, was developed with Internet technology. The FNAP, with a goal of identifying and cataloging all plant species, uses online technology to create","Epiphytic macrolichens were sampled in 203, 0.38 ha plots in the Southeast United States. 176 lichen species were encountered. Gradient analysis revealed two major regional gradients in lichen communities. A multivariate model based on non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to assign gradient scores to plots, based on lichen species composition. The strongest gradient in the lichen communities corresponded to a macroclimatic gradient from the coast through the Piedmont to the Appalachian Mountains. The second major gradient was correlated with air quality, with pollution-tolerant species and lower species richness in urban and industrial areas, and pollution-sensitive species and high species richness in cleaner areas. Epiphytic macrolichens were sparse in urban areas with heavy industry. In many rural areas, lichens were luxuriant and diverse. Species richness was locally variable and only weakly related to the coastto-mountains gradient, with somewhat higher diversity in the mountains and lower diversity on the Piedmont and coast. The Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) program seeks to assess the condition and trend of the forests of the United States (NAPAP 1993; Riiters et al. 1992). FHM is linked with the national sampling grid established by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) of the Environmental Protection Agency. Epiphytic lichen communities were included in FHM because they help to answer several key assessment questions. These questions concern the contamination of natural resources, biodiversity, forest health, and sustainability of timber production. Hundreds of papers worldwide (chronicled in the series \"Literature on air pollution and lichens\" in the Lichenologist) and dozens of review papers and books (e.g., de Wit 1983; Nash &amp; Wirth 1988; Richardson 1992; Seaward 1993; Smith et al. 1993; van Dobben 1993) published during the last century, have documented the close relationship between lichen communities and air pollution, especially SO2 and acidifying or fertilizing nitrogen and sulfur-based pollutants. In a comparison of biological responses between nearby and remote areas surrounding a coal-fired power plant, lichens gave a much clearer response (in terms of diversity, total abundance, and community composition) than either foliar symptoms or tree growth (Muir &amp; McCune 1988). Lichens were one of the few com0007-2745/97/145-158$1.55/0 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.187 on Wed, 30 Mar 2016 05:41:06 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 146 THE BRYOLOGIST [VOL. 100 ponents of terrestrial ecosystems to show a clear relationship to gradients of acidic deposition in the eastern United States (NAPAP 1991; Showman 1992). Much of the sensitivity of epiphytic lichens to air quality apparently results from their lack of a cuticle and their reliance on atmospheric sources of nutrition. Although trees may respond to moderate, chronic levels of air pollution deposition, all of the other influences on tree growth, such as variation in soils, make the responses of trees to pollutants difficult to measure in the field. Lichen communities provide, therefore, not only a measure of air pollution impacts upon lichens, but also suggest air pollution impacts on aspects of forest health that are difficult to measure directly. Elemental content of lichens in the southeastern U.S. has received some study (e.g., Bosserman &amp; Hagner 1981; Kinsman 1990; Walther et al. 1990), but no previous published studies of lichen community response to air pollution have been made in this area. Elsewhere in eastern North America, lichen community response to urban and industrial air pollution has been studied mainly in local urban and industrial areas (LeBlanc et al. 1972; McCune 1988; Muir &amp; McCune 1988; Rao &amp; LeBlanc 1967; Showman 1975, 1981; Will-Wolf 1980). Only Showman (1992) has studied lichen communities on a regional gradient in air quality in North America. In Europe, regional monitoring grids have focussed primarily on elemental analysis of tissues or status of particular species, with only a few largescale studies analyzing community composition (Bruteig 1993; de Wit 1976; van Dobben 1993). In addition to their utility as indicators of air quality, epiphytic lichens are an important component of many forests. Lichens often comprise a large portion of the diversity of macrophytic species in a forest. Lichens have numerous functional roles in temperate forests, including nutrient cycling (especially nitrogen fixation in moist forests; Pike 1978) and as components of food webs (Dawson et al. 1987; Maser et al. 1985; Maser et al. 1986; Rominger &amp; Oldemeyer 1989; Servheen &amp; Lyon 1989). The large-scale sampling of FHM using the EMAP sampling grid allows us to describe regional gradients in lichen community composition as influenced by climate and topography. A multidisciplinary regional sampling grid of this scale is unprecedented in North America, although transcontinental transects in Canada have addressed questions at a similar spatial scale (La Roi 1967; La Roi &amp; Stringer 1976). The current data set extends from Georgia to Virginia, inland to eastern Tennessee. Additional data collected along the whole eastern seaboard in 1994 and 1995 will be analyzed in the future. CALIBRATION PHASE","In recent years, rapid urbanization is leading to a sharp decrease of bird diversity in city. The plant landscape in the greenway plays an important role in habitat conservation. This paper aims to explore the effects of plant landscape planning for the bird habitat conservation in urban greenway, and to study the design methods of greenway plant landscapes based on bird habitats conservation. Wenyu River North Canal, a river located in the east of Beijing with uninterrupted green spaces along the coast, has the potential to become the migration channel for migratory birds. Dongjiao Wetland Park is an important node. At the macro level, the program investigated the vegetation pattern of Wenyu River-North Canal by using GIS technology and analyzed the distribution and ecological connectivity of different bird habitat types in the greenway. The results show that along the Wenyu River-North Canal, the distribution of habitats for some bird groups is uneven and some habitat types are poorly connected. At the micro level, a field study was conducted in Dongjiao Wetland Park in combination with actual projects, in which the forest form distribution and plant species composition were analyzed and the bird biotope was mapped. The results show that in the Dongjiao Wetland Park, the plant community is dominated by arbor-herb type; evergreen plants, shrubs and food plants are lacking; grasslands habitats and wetlands habitats were small and the area disturbed by human is large. According to the analysis results, aiming at bird habitat conservation, a vegetation landscape optimization plan of Wenyu River-North Canal Greenway and a plant landscape reconstruction design of the Northern Park of Dongjiao Wetland Park were proposed, including protecting important habitat patches, optimizing plant community structure and selecting plant species. Introduction In recent years, rapid urbanization is leading to a sharp decline of urban biodiversity. In fact, the surrounding areas of Beijing have been an important stopover for migratory birds since ancient times. However, urban bird diversity is declining. As an important part of urban green space, a greenway can connect the fragmented habitats in cities and play an important role in protecting urban biodiversity. Among them, plant landscape plays an important role in habitat conservation. Greenways with higher plant diversity have higher ecological stability. At the same time, a variety of plant species can provide food and shelter for many animals, such as birds and insects. 1 Zhang, et al.: Study on Greenway Plant Landscape Based on Bird Habitat Conservation Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 2019 In this study, we selected the Wenyu River-North Canal Greenway and Dongjiao Wetland Park as the study area. We analyzed the status of bird habitats within the greenways of Beijing and explored the method of bird habitat conservation in urban greenway through plant landscape from different scales. Background and Literature Review Literature review Urbanization will gradually change the landscape conditions of urban bird habitats and the species composition of urban birds, thus leading to the undesirable development of urban bird communities (Ikin 2012). Habitat connectivity can serve as a corridor for urban birds, with positive implications for increasing bird population and diversity (Fernández-Juricic 2000; Fernández-Juricic and Okimäki 2001). Therefore, the construction of green corridors with diverse habitats can greatly improve the connectivity between urban habitats and is an important green infrastructure in cities (Beier 2010). Among them, the riverside greenway can provide unique habitats for birds, which is irreplaceable (Gentry 2006). The land use, vegetation coverage and vegetation structure in the greenway have important influence on the structure and behavior of urban bird communities (Mason 2007). In addition, attention should be paid to the protection of the surrounding original habitat during the greenway construction, which is conducive to the rapid promotion of the greenway biodiversity (Kang 2015). Within the green patches, vegetation characteristics are the most important factors affecting the quality of bird habitat. A large number of studies have supported that vegetation characteristics of habitats have a significant impact on the distribution of birds. The greater the vegetation coverage in the habitat the greater the density and diversity of the bird communities (Beissinger 1982; James 1982). The higher the abundance of shrubs and herbaceous, the higher the diversity and richness of urban birds in the park. The average age and height of trees and the density of shrubs in the habitat also have effects on the richness of birds. (Ferenc 2014). In addition, the ratio of native plants to exotic plants can also affect urban bird community composition and bird diversity (Burghardt 2009). Study area and site selection Beijing (39°54'20\" N, 116°25'29\" E) is located in the mid-latitude area, with a total area of 16800 km2 (Beijing Statistics Information Website, 2019). Located in the northern part of the North China Plain, Beijing is a typical sub-humid warm temperate continental monsoon climate. The Wenyu River-North Canal Greenway is located in the northeast of Beijing, with a total length of 88.27 kilometers. According to the planning of Beijing green space system, it is one of the most important corridors in Beijing, and an important part of the outer ring water system and the second green belt separation of Beijing. It covers two important river corridors in the \"five rivers and ten roads\" green corridor planning (Beijing municipal commission of planning and natural resource, 2019). The Wenyu River-North Canal River Greenway passes through the urban built-up area to the suburbs, with obvious urbanization gradient change of surrounding land and diverse habitat types,and has the potential to become the migration channel for migratory birds. Dongjiao Wetland Park is an important node in the Wenyu River-North Canal Greenway. It belongs to the four major country park projects identified by the Beijing Green Space System Planning (2004-2020) (Beijing municipal commission of planning and natural resource, 2019). The planned area of Dongjiao Wetland Park is about 118 hectares, including 34.5 hectares in the Northern Park and 83.5 hectares in the Southern Park. 2 Proceedings of the Fábos Conference on Landscape and Greenway Planning, Vol. 6, No. 1 [2019], Art. 11 https://scholarworks.umass.edu/fabos/vol6/iss1/11 DOI: https://doi.org/10.7275/1mrg-kp50 Goals and Objectives The main goal of this paper is to explore the strategies of greenway plant landscape design based on bird habitat conservation. The objectives are to: 1. Analyze and evaluate the distribution of bird habitats in the Wenyu River-North Canal Greenway; 2. Analyze the plant landscape composition of Dongjiao Wetland Park; and 3. Propose an optimization plan of plant landscape aiming at bird habitat conservation. Methods We obtained September 2017 landsat8 satellite images of Wenyu River-North Canal greenway, and analyzed them by supervised classification using GIS. We divide the five habitat types including thick forest, open forest, grassland (including farmland), building land and water body. The forest land, with vegetation coverage more than or equal to 70%, is thick forest and the forest land with vegetation coverage less than 70% is open forest. Taking 1000m as the distance threshold, we used the Conefor 2.6 to analyze the connectivity of bird habitat patches, and regarded the number of components (NC), the integral index of connectivity (IIC), and the value of node importance (dIIC) as the connectivity indicators to evaluate the distribution status. NC is the number of components. A component is a set of nodes in which a path exists between every pair of nodes. As a landscape gets more connected, it will present fewer components. IIC is a binary index for connectivity analysis. It is given by: IIIIMM = ∑ ∑ aaii⋅aajj 1+nnnniijj nn jj=1 nn ii=1 AALL (1) where n is the total number of nodes in the landscape, ai and aj are the attributes of nodes i and j, nlij is the number of links in the shortest path (topological distance) between patches i and j, and AL is the maximum landscape attribute. IIC ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity. dIIC is the importance of an existing node for maintaining landscape connectivity according to IIC. It is calculated as a percentage as: ddIIIIMM = IIIICC−IIIICCrrrrrrrrrrrr IIIICC × 100% (2) where IIC is the integral index value of connectivity when all the initially existing nodes are present in the landscape and IICremove is the integral index value of connectivity after the removal of that single node from the landscape. The higher dIIC the more important that node is for landscape connectivity (Pascual‐Hortal &amp; Saura 2006). We conducted a field survey on the plant landscape of Dongjiao Wetland Park in August 2018. We adopted the grid method to evenly set 54 sample points. The location, habitat type, community appearance (coniferous forest/broad-leaved forest/ theropencedrymion), community structure type and canopy density of each sample were recorded. The name, family, genus, life type, height, crown breadth, breast 3 Zhang, et al.: Study on Greenway Plant Landscape Based on Bird Habitat Conservation Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 2019 diameter/ground diameter, growth vigor, species origin (native /exotic/ invasive), reproduction mode (cultivation/wild), and ornamental characteristics of each plant were recorded. Based on the sample survey, we conducted a detailed survey of the Northern Park, the demonstration area of the Dongjiao Wetland Park, and mapped the plant distribution map of the Northern Park. According to the living habits of birds, we divided the Northern Park into 13 regions based on a 200m×200m grid, and studied the distri","An 'inextricable link' between biological and cultural diversity has been identified and the term bio-cultural diversity has been introduced as a concept denoting the link. Studies on bio-cultural diversity are largely focused on remote and isolated communities with the modes and relations of indigenous production systems being typically subsistence and kin based and involving extraction of wild products from the natural environment. Rural conditions are however rapidly changing in many tropical countries, and the livelihood strategies of communities are becoming increasingly diversified. As a result the worldviews, cultural values and knowledge of large sectors of the population can no longer be classified as 'traditional' nor as representative of western culture. Despite these changes, many of these communities are still reliant on wild resources both for utilitarian and cultural needs. Unfortunately, the theory on bio-cultural diversity as it currently stands only pays homage to one end of the continuum — the more 'exotic' and politically under-represented sectors of the population. This has resulted in very little systematic analysis of the interaction between culture and use of biological diversity, and of the question of whether cultural practices linked to the use of biodiversity are resilient, or rather the persistent, and whether they are maintained under processes of commercialisation and globalization The overall aim of this study is to assess the importance of biodiversity with respect to cultural and utilitarian value amongst different categories of non-traditional community households in both peri-urban and urban contexts of South Africa and to evaluate factors which contribute to the persistent use of biodiversity for cultural practices. It is shown that cultural practices of biodiversity are divers and often still poorly recorded. Even in urban areas and amongst richer people several forms of cultural use of biodiversity are maintained The study gives credibility to the idea that the future of conservation movements depends on their ability to deal with the relation between history, culture and conservation in all its complexity.","Ecosystems are under considerable threat from the environmental consequences of an increasing human population and its even greater demand for energy, water, food, and other natural resources. People depend on ecosystems for their basic requirements of life (e.g., food, water, fuel, shelter) and benefit from the ecosystem functions necessary to sustain our modern lifestyle and well‐being. These benefits are termed ecosystem services and are often classified as provisioning services (e.g., food, fuel), regulating services (e.g., climate regulation, pollination), cultural services (e.g., educational values, aesthetic values), and supporting services (e.g., photosynthesis, nutrient cycling). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (WRI 2005) highlighted the link between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well‐being. More recently, an international study on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity has drawn attention to the global economic benefits of ecosystem services as well as the impacts and dependencies that business has on biodiversity and ecosystems services (TEEB 2010). The ecosystem services concept is gaining increasing prominence in environmental policy making where it is being used as a guiding principle for sustainability. For instance, the European Union (EU) has set a target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020 and restoring them as far as is feasible. Although the concept is gaining popularitywith regulators and policymakers, andmuch attention has been given to the valuation of ecosystem services, the underlying science required to put policy into practice is still under development. Sustainable management of ecosystem services is more than improving environmental quality; it also requires a consideration of trade‐offs between ecosystem services as well as spatial and temporal discontinuities between service provision and use in the long term. Local scale actions may have consequences at the landscape, national, or global scale. Hence the scientific understanding used to underpin the evaluation and management of ecosystem services needs to apply at these larger spatial scales and needs to consider landscape structure. The articles in this special issue were presented at the 5th Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Europe Special Science Symposium,whichwas held in Brussels in February 2012. They provide an overview of the use of the ecosystem services concept, ranging from policy views to practical applications and raise a number of opportunities and challenges associated with implementing the ecosystem service approach in environmental management and protection. Apitz (this issue) provides an overview of the role of ecosystem service approaches in environmental management policy and practice. The approaches range from natural capital assessments and assessments of environmental impact, damage, and liability in planning decisions, to evaluations of remediation and disposal options, and product safety. She considers 3 main components of the decision‐making process: decision analysis, which defines the proposed policies or actions and changes under consideration; assessment, which evaluates how such changes affect biophysical structure and hence ecosystem functions and services; and valuation, which generates valuations (monetary or nonmonetary) to inform decisions linking back to decision analysis. The services to be considered depend on the context and scale of the scenarios envisioned—broad ecosystem service categories (e.g., fisheries, transport) being appropriate for high‐level analyses (top‐down assessments), but more specific services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination) being the focus of detailed biophysical assessments (bottom‐up assessments). Top‐down assessments may be used to assess national or regional stock and flows of ecosystem services and to evaluate the impacts of national or regional planning and development. Whereas, bottom‐up assessments that derive estimates of ecosystem services from the links between biophysical conditions, functions, and services may be used to assess the risk of a particular stressors to ecosystem service delivery or to select between remediation, disposal, mitigation, or liability options. Ecosystem service provision is related to land cover and land use. Dunbar et al. (this issue) discuss EU policies that are relevant to the ecosystem services provided by 3 major land cover types: agriculture, protected areas, and urban areas. Agriculture accounts for approximately 40% of the total land area of Europe and although it is primary managed for provisioning services (e.g., food production), it also provides many other important ecosystem services, some of which also have a positive impact on agricultural production (e.g., pollination, pest and disease control, nutrient cycling). The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the main policy instrument for protecting ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Agri‐environment schemes implemented under CAP are directly related to soil protection. Recent proposals for CAP reform include identifying restoring and conserving ecosystem services as 1 of the 6 priorities for rural development and dedicating 7% of agricultural land as “Ecological Focus Areas.” The NATURA 2000 network of protected areas, created under the EU Habitats Directive and Bird Directive, comprises 17% of the total area of the EU. Although originally designated to conserve biodiversity, protected areas provide a wide range of ecosystem services including wood production, C sequestration, air purification, groundwater recharge, and recreation. Europe is one of the most urbanized continents in the world with 80% of Europeans living in or around cities. Ecosystem service provision in urban areas is largely dependent on green space (e.g., forest, trees, parks). However, these green * To whom correspondence may be addressed: vanwensem@tcbodem.nl","The intensive three-dimensional urban landscape has become a trend in urban mode development, which might be one of the effective ways of solving problems such as the shortage of living space in the city, and the contradiction between three-dimensional urban elements and the urban bases. The three-dimensional city would become one of the important city models in the future. For urban landscape ecology, the spatial effect of configurations and functions in urban landscape not only exists in the plane space, just as the maps showed, but also affects the spatiotemporal change of urban landscape in three-dimensional space. As a result, study on the spatial pattern and functional characteristics should not be localized in the two-dimensional plane. This paper reviews the concepts, research method and experience of two-dimensional urban landscape, and advances the basic characteristics of three-dimensional urban landscape. The results show that three-dimensional landscape pattern and landscape functional network are the basic important characteristics of three-dimensional urban landscape. First of all, retrieval of three-dimensional information was the precondition for studying three-dimensional urban landscape. Currently, a series of techniques have been successfully used to retrieve the variation of urban landscape in the vertical scale from remotely-sensed data, including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Airborne Photogrammetry, etc. The paper introduces in detail the basic steps for the retrieval of vertical characteristics of building, road, tree and shrub from LiDAR data. Three-dimensional information extraction from LiDAR data could be simplified as the processes of subtraction of DTM from original DSM, which would generate the so-called normalized DSM (nDSM). nDSM could be seen as the representation of objects rising from the terrain placed approximately on a plane. Conventional urban landscape pattern analysis means the integrated results of different landscape types, including composition and configuration. When urban landscape vertical heterogeneity is considered, decomposition of urban landscape into various components with different vertical characteristics using remotely sensed data is a new research field which could provide more economical and ecological meaningful parameters for quantifying the urban environment and its changes. First, this paper reviews in detail the latest achievements and frontiers of three-dimensional urban landscape ecology. Secondly, by comparing and analyzing the main methods and models in the retrieval of three-dimensional landscape elements, we propose a research framework for three-dimensional urban landscape ecology, including the extraction of three-dimensional urban landscape elements, measurement of three-dimensional landscape pattern characteristics, detection and modeling of three-dimensional landscape dynamics, ecological and environmental effects on biodiversity and local climate change, and urban landscape-function relations based on the concept of a landscape functional network. Finally, this paper discusses the existing problems and gives an outlook of future research directions.","SUMMARY Flagship species are among key marketing tools used by conservation organizations to motivate public support, but are often selected in an ad hoc, rather than systematic, manner. Furthermore, it is unclear whether selected flagship species do motivate public support. This paper describes a multi-method exploratory study, carried out in Switzerland, which aimed to determine the selection criteria for flagship species and measure whether a species selected according to these criteria was able to motivate support. Fourteen representatives of international, regional and local conservation organizations were interviewed and the selection criteria for their flagship species were identified. A charismatic species (the great spotted woodpecker) that meets these criteria and an apparently less charismatic species (the clover stem weevil) were selected as treatments in a quantitative experiment with 900 respondents. Using conjoint analysis, it was found that both charismatic and uncharismatic species have the ability to positively influence public preferences for habitat variables that encourage biodiversity in urban landscapes. These results may be used by conservation organizations to assist in the selection of flagship species, and in particular for flagship species that are intended to perform a specific conservation function.","It is sometimes claimed that the concept “sustainable development” can be interpreted in many different ways and therefore is difficult to operationalize and use for example in planning processes. In 2015, governments all around the world agreed on a set of Sustainable Development Goals. They are universal, connected and undividable. The goals and the document, Agenda 2030, is unique and taken together they can be seen as a global consensus on the goals for sustainable development. One of the seventeen goals is directly related to cities and urban development. For sustainable urban development it is however not enough to focus on this goal alone since important aspects are included also in other goals. In this paper we will discuss how sustainable urban development can be defined using the Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals as a starting point. Such goals are useful for example for urban planning. Experience shows that clear goals are often lacking in planning processes and that is especially so for goals related to sustainability. Goals should be relevant for different possible futures and not pending on for example uncertain specific economic developments. The focus here will be on a European and a Swedish context, but with an outlook also to other parts of the world. Introduction When facing environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss, but also issues like poverty and health, the sustainability concept has gained importance in decisionmaking at different levels of society. In spite of its significance, or maybe due to it, it is sometimes claimed that the concept “sustainable development” can be interpreted in many different ways and therefore is difficult to operationalize and use for example in planning processes (Gunnarsson-Östling et al, 2013). These different interpretations can be said to belong to parallel sustainability discourses that mirror different views of human relations to nature, but also in their view on justice, what are defined as problems and what are seen as solutions (Gunnarsson-Östling and Svenfelt, forthcoming). Even if different views on nature, justice, problems and solutions exist, governments around the world agreed on a set of Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 (UN, 2015). They are universal, connected and undividable. The goals and the document, Agenda 2030, is unique and taken together they can be seen as a global consensus on the goals for sustainable development. One of the seventeen goals is directly related to cities and urban development. For sustainable urban development it is however not enough to focus on this goal alone since important aspects are included also in other goals. In this paper we will discuss how sustainable urban development can be defined using the Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals as a starting point. Such goals are useful for example for urban planning. Experience shows that clear goals are often lacking in planning processes and that is especially so for goals related to sustainability. Purpose of planning Based on European directives, according to Swedish law (PBL 2010:900, MB 1998:808), programs, plans and activities with significant environmental impact should be assessed. The assessment should encompass an analysis of alternatives compatible with the purpose of the plan. The idea is that decision makers should thereby be able to decide for the best option. The importance of alternatives in environmental assessment of plans and programs is emphasized by the Swedish government because planning takes on a more strategic level, and it may be appropriate to assess alternative solutions in a different way than when it comes to specific activities (Prop. 2003/04:116, p. 40). Comprehensive plans are therefore always seen as likely to cause significant environmental impact and they should therefore be assessed through a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). In the research project SPEAK, Swedish comprehensive plans for the period 2004-2014 have been collected. Each of Sweden’s 290 municipalities should have a valid comprehensive plan. However, in this dataset only 229 (79%) turned out to have that (Wallström, 2015). In order to get a deeper understanding of the plans, a stratified sample of 80 municipalities was made in the SPEAK project. This sample covers 19 out of the 21 Swedish counties and represents different types of municipalities (according to Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions typology). In this sample approximately 40% was describing their comprehensive plan’s aim within the Environmental Assessment (Wärnbäck and Gunnarsson-Östling, forthcoming). It became clear that aims are often described in a general way (sometimes just stating what is prescribed by the Plan and building act; that the comprehensive plan should indicate the direction of the long term development of the physical environment) and not specifically for the location (Wärnbäck and Gunnarsson-Östling, forthcoming). When the plans lack purposes, which make it difficult to come up with alternative solutions, it is no wonder that goal conflicts are not handled either. If the purpose is not clear, what goals are then to be fulfilled? Management by objectives is a substantial element of Swedish public 1 http://speakproject.se/en/startsida/ (accessed 20160929) administration, so there are many goals/objectives to choose between and planning should not only meet environmental objectives but also contribute to other important societal goals. Sometimes the objectives, or proposed means to reach the objectives, are not compatible with each other. In Sweden, conflicting goals have mostly been given attention at the national level (Myhrberg, 2016). However, knowledge about conflicting goals and how they are handled at the local level is more limited. Within municipalities’ comprehensive planning there is currently no practice to manage conflicts neither in the plan, nor in the environmental assessment. This has in practice led to individual municipalities trying out own solutions, with uneven results (Myhrberg, 2016). The absence of tools and support for systematic management of conflicts of objectives has also attracted the attention of the National Housing Board (Boverket, 2014) as a fundamental problem in planning at regional and local level. Myhrberg’s (2016) study of the Swedish comprehensive plans in the SPEAK stratified sample shows that only 12% of the comprehensive plans contain a structured analysis of goal conflicts, 49% contain some traces of what might be seen as an analysis of goal conflicts while 39% does not make any analysis at all of goal conflicts (Myhrberg, 2016). By structured analysis Myhrberg (2016) means that conflicting objectives are either discussed in a specific chapter, or otherwise taken up in a way that shows a continuous observation and analysis of conflicting objectives. Also in transportation planning, environmental goals are sometimes lacking or unquantified making it difficult to include them in the decision-making process (Finnveden and Åkerman, 2014). One reason to make the purpose unclear and conceal conflicts of objectives can be that politicians do not want to make their choices between fulfilling different targets clear. But by stating clear purposes and clarifying goal conflicts we believe that planning could become a matter of real choice. Instead of striving for superficial consensus and win-win solutions, the political dimensions and conflicts in play when planning for sustainable development could be spelled out. When having clear purposes, real alternatives can be assessed which means that the political content of planning will be rendered visible. Thus, different views on nature, justice, problems and solutions can be spelled out in different alternatives and assessed to clarify whether they reach important targets or not. Sustainable Development Goals for cities There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals in Agenda 2030 (UN, 2015). Under each of them, here are also more specific targets, altogether 169. One of the goals, No 11, is “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The targets under this goal are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Targets under the SDG 11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” + 11.1 By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic Services and upgrade slums 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons 11.3 By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, Integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries 11.4 Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage 11.5 By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management 11.7 By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities 11.a Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, periurban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning 11.b By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plan","25 The US National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS) is the world’s largest wilderness 26 protection network, yet within the contiguous US (CONUS) it does not encompass the diversity 27 nor is it fully representative of ecological systems on federal lands. To potentially increase 28 NWPS diversity and representation, we simulated adding potentially eligible lands within 29 CONUS, in the following sequence, to assess changes in ecological systems: National Park 30 Lands not currently designated wilderness; non-NWPS lands currently managed to not degrade 31 wilderness character; US Forest Service Inventoried Roadless Areas; and Bureau of Land 32 Management roadless lands. Inclusion of these categories would increase the NWPS area from 33 12.8% to 48.3% of federal lands, increase diversity by adding 46 ecological systems, and nearly 34 triple the number of ecological systems on federal lands with &gt;20% representation. Our analysis 35 identifies opportunities to increase diversity and representation of ecological systems within the 36 NWPS. 37 Management and Policy Implications 38 Over 50 years ago, the Wilderness Act (1964) established a process for adding lands to the 39 National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). If the goal of wilderness management and 40 policy is to provide the best possible representation of ecological systems within the NWPS, then 41 adding lands to the NWPS will be vital for preserving the diversity of species and habitats found 42 throughout the contiguous US (CONUS). Adding lands to the NWPS will also provide the most 43 robust wilderness protection network for adapting to future land-use and climate change. We 44 demonstrated which land designation categories among National Park lands not currently 45 designated wilderness; non-NWPS lands currently managed to not degrade wilderness character; 46 US Forest Service Inventoried Roadless Areas; and Bureau of Land Management roadless lands 47 provide the greatest opportunities for diversifying and increasing representation of ecological 48 systems. This information can inform future management and policy of the NWPS. All 4 land 49 designation categories provide important opportunities for increasing ecological systems 50 representation. However, even if all land designation categories were added to the NWPS, 64 51 ecological systems on federal lands (12%) would remain unrepresented. There is, nonetheless, 52 substantial opportunity to diversify the NWPS and increase levels of representation of ecological 53 systems. 54 Introduction 55 Noss and Cooperrider (1994; p. 89) stated that a first principle of conservation planning 56 is to “represent, in a system of protected areas, all native ecosystem types...across their natural 57 range of variation.” Expanding the representation of ecological systems (i.e., native ecosystem 58 types) within a protected area network (i.e., a network of lands having permanent protection from 59 conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan to maintain a natural state; USGS60 GAP 2012), has 3 primary benefits. First, maximizing the diversity of ecological systems 61 represented in protected areas will likely protect greater numbers of species and their habitat. For 62 example, Pouzols et al. (2014) showed that protected area expansion, if strategically 63 implemented, could triple the average protection of vertebrate species ranges. Second, greater 64 diversity of ecological systems represented in a protected area network may enhance the 65 resilience of species and habitats to global changes (Shaffer and Stein 2000). Third, greater 66 representation of ecological systems in areas protected from human-caused disturbance can serve 67 as reference areas for comparison to more highly-managed or human-impacted areas (Belote et 68 al. in press). Leopold (1949, p. 196) recognized the benefit of an ecologically representative 69 protected area network by stating that “each biotic province needs its own land for comparative 70 studies of used and unused land.” 71 The value of an ecologically representative system has long been recognized, even 72 though few existing protected areas were established explicitly to protect representative 73 examples of ecological systems. Over the last few decades, additions to the global protected area 74 network have not commensurately increased ecological representation, but rather have 75 maintained the bias towards high altitude and low productivity areas (Aycrigg et al. 2013, 76 Watson et al. 2014). This is consistent with the lack of complete ecological system representation 77 found within the protected area network of the United States (US) and, more specifically, within 78 the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS; Aycrigg et al. 2013, Dietz et al. 2015). 79 Over the past 50 years, the NWPS has protected numerous large unfragmented areas, but has yet 80 to achieve the full representation of ecological systems found on federal lands (Dietz et al. 2015). 81 In 1964, the US Congress established the most protective of protected area networks, the 82 NWPS, to preserve “natural conditions” and “ecological, geological, or other features of 83 scientific...value” (The Wilderness Act (WA) 1964, section 2c). Examining the ecological 84 diversity and representation in the NWPS as a distinct protected areas network is important for 2 85 reasons. First, the NWPS, which comprises 12.8% of the total federal lands, 13.6% of the 86 protected area network, and approximately 2.6% of the contiguous US (CONUS), is functionally 87 and legally distinct from other protected areas within the US because the system has a high level 88 of protection and prohibits many human activities, such as road-building, logging, energy 89 development (i.e., oil and gas drilling), off-road motor vehicles, developed tourism facilities, and 90 permanent structures (WA 1964, section 4c). Second, WA provides for the expansion of the 91 NWPS in a systematic way (WA 1964, section 3). For example, all 4 federal land management 92 agencies (i.e., National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Fish and 93 Wildlife Service (FWS), and US Forest Service (USFS)) are legally required to evaluate the need 94 for new wilderness areas during their land and resource management planning process. In 95 addition, roadless areas possessing wilderness characteristics, which are among potentially 96 suitable federal lands, are eligible for wilderness designation. 97 Areas outside the NWPS, but with wilderness character, are becoming rare because of 98 pressures from land-use changes, such as demands for energy development and urban expansion 99 surrounding these areas (Martinuzzi et al. 2015). Consequently, these areas are becoming a more 100 important component of a comprehensive strategy to protect biodiversity. Even though there are 101 many types of protected areas (on federal, state, local, and private lands) that contribute to 102 biodiversity conservation throughout the US, the NWPS serves a unique role and it could better 103 conserve biodiversity if its resilience could be strengthened by identifying the most ecologically104 important areas to diversify its ecological representation on federal land. 105 Dietz et al. (2015) found that while the total area of the NWPS within CONUS has 106 increased steadily over last 50 years, the number of ecological systems represented in wilderness 107 reached an asymptote approximately 30 years ago. The number of ecological systems 108 represented was below the total number of ecological systems that occur on federal land and 109 therefore could potentially be included in the NWPS. 110 We extended the analysis of Dietz et al. (2015) to simulate the potential for increasing the 111 diversity and representation of ecological systems by sequential and cumulative additions to the 112 NWPS. We identified 4 spatially distinct and mutually exclusive land designation categories that 113 could be included in the NWPS. First, we included National Park lands that are not designated as 114 wilderness, but are eligible for wilderness designation (WA 1964, section 3c). We excluded 115 portions of National Parks that were already designated wilderness, National Parks that were 116 established principally for cultural resources or as scenic roadways, and National Parks &lt;5,000 117 acres, which is, with some exceptions, the minimum size for wilderness areas (WA 1964, section 118 2c). Second, we included congressionally or administratively recommended wilderness areas 119 including USFS and BLM Wilderness Study Areas (WSA) and areas recommended for 120 wilderness by USFS, BLM, and FWS. These lands are currently managed so as not to degrade 121 their wilderness character. This category excludes any areas that are within National Parks to 122 keep it distinct from our first category (from here forward we refer to this category as ‘lands 123 managed so as not to degrade their wilderness character’). Third, we included USFS Inventoried 124 Roadless Areas (IRAs) that are not included in the second category. Fourth, we included BLM 125 roadless areas that are not included in the second category. We chose these land designation 126 categories and this sequence because they represent our estimate of the current level of 127 protection already afforded these lands and the likelihood of securing sufficient public support 128 for their addition to the NWPS under the process established by WA (1964). We wanted to 129 compare our results to the results of Dietz et al. (2015); therefore we used CONUS as the spatial 130 extent for our analysis. Our objectives are to evaluate the change in ecological system diversity 131 (i.e., how many ecological systems) and representation (i.e., what proportion of an ecological 132 system) by simulating the addition of each of 4 land designation categories to the NWPS (Table 133 1). As in Dietz et al. (2015), we used 20% as a convenient threshold ","The nature of wildlife management throughout the world is changing. The increase in the world’s human population has been accompanied by a rapid expansion of agricultural and urban areas and infrastructures, especially road and railway networks. Worldwide, wildlife habitats are being transformed and fragmented by human activities, and the behavior of several species has changed as a result of human activities. Some species have adapted easily to urban or peri–urban habitats and take advantage of the new resources available. These data provide the context for why human–wildlife interactions are increasing. \nAt the 30th International Union of Game Biologists Congress held in Barcelona in early September 2011, in addition to two plenary presentations, 52 authors from 12 different countries and three continents presented 15 papers in the Interactions of Humans and Wildlife Session, three of which are included in this volume. To some extent, all the papers reflected the inherent difficulty in solving the complex problems caused either by rapidly increasing species that begin to inhabit urban and agricultural areas in numbers not seen previously (e.g. coyotes, Canis latrans, inhabiting big cities; wild boar, Sus scrofa, across western Europe; wood pigeons, Columba palumbus, in France), or species whose populations are threatened by human activities (e.g., Eurasian Lynx, Lynx lynx, in the Czech Republic). Some papers addressed the contentious issue of predator control (e.g., gamebirds in Great Britain), while others presented data regarding how human activities influenced animal behavior (e.g., pink footed geese, Anser brachyrhynchus; and red deer, Cervus elaphus, in Germany). \nThe papers presented at the congress show how human activities affect the distributions and dynamics of wildlife populations and also change the behavior of some species. Wildlife causes social and economic conflicts by damaging agricultural and forest resources, bringing about traffic collisions, and creating problems for residents in urban areas; while many are increasingly distant from nature and may not accept the presence of wildlife others may actively encourage the presence of wild animals. \nThe first paper in this volume, by Cahill et al. (2012), analyzes the management challenges of the increasing abundance of wild boar in the peri–urban area of Barcelona. This conflict has arisen in other large cities in Europe and elsewhere. The presence of the species causes problems for many residents, to such an extent that it is considered a pest in these areas. Wild boar habituation has not only been facilitated by population expansion, but also by the attitudes of some citizens who encourage their presence by direct feeding. This leads to wild boar behavior modification and also promotes an increase in the fertility rate of habituated females, which are significantly heavier than non–habituated females. Public attitudes regarding the species and harvesting methods (at present most specimens are removed by live capture and subsequently sacrificed) are highlighted as one of the key factors in the management of the conflict. \nThe second paper provides an example of how the distribution of irrigated croplands influences wild boar roadkills in NW Spain (Colino–Rabanal et al., 2012). By modeling the spatial distribution of wild boar collisions with vehicles and using generalized additive models based on GIS, the authors show that the number of roadkills is higher in maize croplands than in forested areas. This factor is the main explanatory variable in the model. The paper provides an excellent example of how the synergies of diverse human elements in the landscape (maize croplands and roads in this case) affect the location and dimensions of these types of conflicts. \nThe third and final paper, by Belotti et al. (2012), addresses the effects of tourism on Eurasian lynx movements and prey usage at Sumava National Park in the Czech Republic. The monitoring of 5 GPS–collared lynxes and analyses of data regarding habitat features suggests that human disturbance (proximity of roads and tourist trails) can modify the presence of lynxes during the day close to the site where they have hidden a prey item, such as an ungulate, that can provide them with food for several days. In such cases, adequate management of tourism development must involve a commitment to species conservation. \nThe analyses and understanding of all these phenomena and the design of successful wildlife management strategies and techniques used to mitigate the conflicts require a good knowledge base that considers information both about wildlife and human attitudes. The papers presented stress the importance of spatial analyses of the interactions and their relationship with landscape features and the location of human activities. Species distribution and abundance are related to important habitat variables such as provision of shelter, food, comfortable spaces, and an appropriate climate. Therefore, it is essential to analyze these data adequately to predict where conflicts are most likely to arise and to design successful mitigation strategies. The second key factor for adequate management of human–wildlife interactions is to monitor system change. An analysis of the variety of data on population dynamics, hunting, wildlife collisions, and wildlife presence in urban areas would provide a basis for adaptive management. In this respect, in the plenary session, Steve Redpath mentioned the importance of the wildlife biologist’s attitude when interpreting and drawing conclusions from recorded data and stressed the importance of conducting clear, relevant, and transparent science for participants involved in the management decision process, which often involves a high number of stakeholders. \nAll of the papers addressing the problems associated with human wildlife interactions were characterized by a common theme. Regardless of the specific nature of the problem, the public was generally divided on how the problem should be addressed. A particularly sensitive theme was that of population control methods, especially when conflicts are located in peri–urban areas. Several presenters acknowledged that public participation was necessary if a solution was to be reached. Some suggested, as have other authors (Heydon et al., 2010), that a legislative framework may be needed to reconcile human and wildlife interests. However, each problem that was presented appeared to involve multiple stakeholders with different opinions. Solving these kinds of problems is not \ntrivial. Social factors strongly influence perceptions of human–wildlife conflicts but the methods used to mitigate these conflicts often take into account technical aspects but not people’s attitudes. A new, more innovative and interdisciplinary approach to mitigation is needed to allow us 'to move from conflict towards coexistence' (Dickman, 2010). Other authors also mentioned the importance of planning interventions that optimize the participation of experts, policy makers, and affected communities and include the explicit, systematic, and participatory evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative interventions (Treves et al., 2009). \nOne technique that has been used to solve problems like these is termed Structured Decision Making (SDM). \nThis technique was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As described by Runge et al. (2009), the process is 'a formal application of common sense for situations too complex for the informal use of common sense', and provides a rational framework and techniques to aid in prescriptive decision making. Fundamentally, the process entails defining a problem, deciding upon the objectives, considering the alternative actions and the consequences for each, using the available science to develop a model (the plan), and then making the decision how to implement (Runge et al., 2009). Although complex, SDM uses a facilitator to guide stakeholders through the process to reach a mutually agreed–upon plan of action. \nIt is clear that human–wildlife interactions are inherently complex because many stakeholders are usually involved. A rational approach that incorporates all interested parties would seem to be a productive way of solving these kinds of problems. \n \nReferences \nCahill, S., Llimona, F., Cabaneros, L. &amp; Calomardo, F., 2012.

Biomass is the primary source of energy for majority of the population in Africa; in Sub-Saharan African Countries fuelwood and charcoal are the staple energy sources for most rural and urban communities. Using Cross-Sectional survey data from a sample of 500 households’ in Gombe State of Nigeria the study investigates the impact of wealth distribution on energy consumption, and analysis the determinants of households’ energy choice for cooking. The simple descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model is used in analysing the data obtained. An empirical result of the logit model reveals that the choice of cooking energy is mainly determined by the economic wealth of households’. Besides the economic wealth, the analysis also shows that size of households’ and level of education are found to be key factors in energy consumption behaviour, especially when dealing with energy source switching. Economic wealth of households’ was found to be a major determinant of the type of cooking energy used by households’ in Nigeria. Wood was used by the low-income households’ as the main source of cooking energy while the modern fuels are used by the upper class in the society. 1.0 INTRODUCTION In developing countries, most of the rural as well as urban communities have less access to modern and clean energy sources and mostly depend on traditional fuel /biomass (woods, twigs, leaves, charcoal, animal dung and crop residue) for virtually all their energy requirements. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 billion people in developing countries rely on biomass fuels to meet their cooking needs. For many of these countries, more than 90 percent of total household fuel is biomass. Without new policies, the number of people that rely on biomass fuels is expected to increase to 2.6 billion by 2015, and 2.7 billion by 2030 (about one-third of the world‘s population) due to population growth (IEA 2006). While rural households‘ rely more on biomass fuels than those in urban areas, well over half of all urban households‘ in sub-Saharan Africa rely on fuelwood, charcoal, or wood waste to meet their cooking needs (IEA 2006). With increasing population and urbanization over time, urban household energy is an important issue for developing countries in general. Heavy reliance of urban households‘ in Sub-Saharan Africa on biomass fuels (such as woody biomass and dung) contribute to deforestation, forest degradation, and land degradation. This is partly because use of these fuels in urban areas is an important source of cash income for people in both urban and rural areas. While use of woody biomass as fuel and as construction material contributes to deforestation and forest degradation, use of dung as fuel implies that it might not be available for use as fertilizer—thus contributing to land degradation and consequent reduction in agricultural productivity. Over 60% of Nigeria's population depends on fuelwood for cooking and other domestic uses (ECN, 2003). The rural areas have little access to conventional energy such as electricity and petroleum products due to absence of good road networks. Petroleum products such as kerosene and gasoline are purchased in the rural areas at prices very high in excess of their official pump prices. The rural populace, whose needs are often basic, therefore depend to a large extent on fuelwood as a major traditional source of fuel. It has been estimated that about 86% of rural households‘ in Nigeria depend on fuelwood as their source of energy (Williams, 1998). Fuelwood supply/demand imbalance in some parts of the country is now a real threat to the energy security of the rural communities (ECN, 2003). 2 Nigeria consumes over 50 million metric tonnes of fuelwood annually, a rate, which exceeds the replenishment rate through various afforestation programme (ICCDD, 2000). Sourcing fuelwood for domestic and commercial uses is a major cause of desertification in the arid-zone states and erosion in the southern part of the country (Sambo, 2009). The rate of deforestation is about 350,000 hectares per year, which is equivalent to 3.6% of the present area of forests and woodlands, whereas reforestation is only at about 10% of the deforestation rate (ICCDD, 2000). From available statistics, the nation‘s 15 million hectares of forest and woodland reserves could be depleted within the next fifty years (ECN, 2003). These would result in negative impacts on the environment, such as soil erosion, desertification, loss of biodiversity, micro-climatic change and flooding. Most of these impacts are already evident in different ecological zones in the country, amounting to huge economic losses (Sambo, 2009). The consumption of fuelwood is worsened by the widespread use of inefficient cooking methods that are hazardous to human health, especially to women and children who mostly do the cooking in homes. It has been argued that households‘ with low income levels rely on biomass fuels, such as wood and dung, while those with higher incomes consume energy that is cleaner and more expensive, such as Liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Those households‘ in transition consume what are called transition fuels, such as kerosene and charcoal. This fuel choice and consumption behaviour of households‘ is known as the ―energy ladder hypothesis‖. Apart from high income, one set of factors necessary for switching to other fuels households‘ is cheap and better availability of alternative fuels other than traditional biomass fuels. Empirical evidence has shown that for many households‘, the decision over which fuel to use or how much of the fuel to use, requires the consideration of several important factors. For instance Narain et al (2008) found that fuelwood use and dependence (defined as its contribution to the total ̳permanent income‘ of households‘) increases with forest biomass availability irrespective of income levels. Also, access to electricity has been found to be another important determinant of the energy transition (Campbell et al. 2003; Davis 1998; Ouedraogo 2006). Others are house standard, level of education of husband and wife, occupation of wife, frequency of cooking certain meals and household size (Alam et al. 1998; Ouedraogo 2005; Madubansi and Shackleton 2007; Pundo and Fraser, 2006). The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of wealth distribution on energy consumption, and to analyse the determinants of households‘ energy choice for cooking in Gombe State of Nigeria. The paper is divided into five sections. The introduction in section one is followed by section two which presents the conceptual framework, and a brief review of some theoretical and related literature. The data collected and methods of analysis are discussed in section three while section four presents and discusses the results. Finally, the paper is concluded in section five and some policy recommendations are also given. 2.0 REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND SOME THEORETICAL ISSUES 2.1 Defining the Concept of Wealth In common use ̳wealth‘ means money, property, gold and so on. But in economics it is used to describe all things that have value. Wealth is the total value of a person‘s net worth expressed as: Wealth = assets − liabilities Wealth may be held in various forms: these include money, shares in companies, debt instruments, land, buildings, intellectual property, and valuables etc (Black, 2002).The wealth of individuals is believed to affect their choices of consumption, thus the part of wealth that have direct influence on consumption is income. Understanding the effect of income on consumption has been a central point of a great deal of theorizing work for example the Keynes ―Absolute Income Hypothesis‖, ―Duesenberry‘s ―Relative Income Hypothesis‖, Modigliani and Brumberg ―Life Cycle Hypothesis‖ and the ―Permanent Income Hypothesis‖ of Friedman. 3 The preferred theory here is the Keynesian – Absolute income hypothesis which is based on the assumption that, consumption depends on income. Or simply, the major influence on personal consumption is an individual income. And this is what portrays the real picture of the consumption pattern of the people living in the study area. 2.2 The Energy Ladder Model Household fuel choice has often been conceptualized using the ―energy ladder‖ model (Figure1); the model emphasized the role of income in determining fuel choices and fuel switching. Figure 1: Energy Ladder Model From W.H.O (2006) (Figure 1: The energy ladder: household and development inextricably linked) Note: Ethanol and methanol are rarely, if ever, used. Dash: estimate WHO (2006) (Figure 1: The energy ladder: household energy and development inextricably linked) Note: Ethanol and Methanol are rarely, if ever, used. Dash: estimate The energy ladder model envisions a three-stage fuel switching process. The first stage is marked by universal reliance on biomass. In the second stage households‘ move to ―transition‖ fuels such as kerosene, coal and charcoal in response to higher incomes and factors such as deforestation and urbanization. In the third phase households‘ switch to LPG, natural gas, or electricity. The main driver affecting the movement up the energy ladder is hypothesized to be income and relative fuel prices (Leach, 1992; Barnes, Krutilla, and Hyde, 2002; Barnes and Floor, 1999). The major achievement of the energy ladder model in its simplest form is the ability to capture the strong income dependence of fuel choices. Several studies have been conducted to test the energy ladder hypothesis. Hosier and Dowd (1987) conducted a study in urban Zimbabwe using a multinomial logit model, the result revealed that although economic factors do affect fuel choices, a large number of other factors such as culture, social desirability an","This study attempted to develop a model for selecting sites for ecologically effective, multi-functional wetlands during the environmental and ecological planning stage, prior to land use Planning. This model was developed with an emphasis upon the creation of a water circulation system for a newly-created city, dispersing and retaining the run-off that is increased due to urbanization and securing spaces to create wetlands that can promote urban biodiversity. A series of Precesses for selecting sites for wetland restoration and creation - watershed analysis, selection of evaluation items, calculation of weights, reparation of thematic maps and synthesis - were incorporated into the model. Its potentials and limitations were examined by applying it to the recently-planned WiRae New Community Development Area, which is located in the Seoul metropolitan region. At the watershed analysis stage, the site was divided into 13 sub-catchment areas. Inflow to watersheds including the area was Run-off before and after development is estimated as and , respectively. The total storage capacity required in the development area amounts to . When thematic maps were overlapped during the selection stage for wetland sites, 13 sub-catchment areas were prioritized for wetland restoration and creation. The locations and areas for retaining run-off showed that various types of wetlands, including retaining wetlands (area wetlands), riverine wetlands (linear wetlands) and pond wetlands (point wetlands), can be created and that they can be systematically connected. By providing a basic framework for the water circulation system plan of an entire city, it may be used effectively in the space planning stage, such as planning an urban eco-network through integration with greet areas. In order to estimate reasonable run-off and create an adequate water circulation system however, a feedback process following land use planning is required. This study strived to promote urban changes in a positive direction while minimizing urban changes in negative forms.","2: in Europe Preamble. This series of two papers is based on a PhD thesis (Koellner 2003) and develops a method on how to assess land use impacts on biodiversity in the framework of LCA. Part 1 further expands the analytical framework of the thesis for pure land occupation and land use change. Part 2 rests on a much richer database compared to the thesis in order to quantify generic characterization factors for local species' richness. Recommendations and Perspectives. One main problem to address is the development of reliable generic characterization factors, which express the ecosystem damage potential of specific land use types. The characterization factors should be developed on an empirical basis, which allow decision makers to get access to knowledge from environmental sciences in a very con-densed form. In order to support decisions on distinct land use projects, methods should be developed, which allow accomplish-ing a generic assessment with site-dependent assessments. Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. In the framework of LCA, land use is broadly accepted as an impact category. However, the methodology for the assessment of damages on the natural en- vironment was and still is the subject of discussion. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to that discussion by providing a consistent methodological framework for the assessment of land occupation and transformation. Methods. We clarify the context of LCA relevant land use deci- sions. Based on that, we develop a formal model with damage functions and generic characterization factors for quantifying damages on ecosystems from land occupation and land transformation. The characterization factor for land occupation and land use change is labeled Ecosystem Damage Potential ( EDP ). We analytically address the substitutability of area and time occupied in order to produce a constant output. Results. Based on the proposed method, it is possible to calcu- late the damages from complex series of land transformation, land occupation, and land restoration. A main feature of the method is that land transformation is assessed based on a fac-tual or virtual, restoration time. This means that the damage of land transformation is largest for land use types which are difficult to restore and need extremely long to develop (e.g. thou- sand of years and more for primary forest and peatbog). In addition, we could show that area and time of occupation are not substitutable. The more severe the damage potential of a specific land use type is, the better it is to minimize the area and maximize the duration of occupation. Discussion. An approach for the assessment of pure land occu- pation and land use change was developed in this paper, which is not geographically referenced. Developing geographically-ref- erenced land use inventories and impact assessment methods can increase their accuracy. The information cost to provide geographically referenced data on land use for practical LCA applications, however, would increase enormously. Conclusions. An impact assessment method for land use with generic characterization factors improves the basis for decision-making in industry and other organizations. It can best be ap- plied to marginal land use decisions; that is, to decisions in which the consequences are so small that the quality or quantity of environmental parameters of a region is not noticeably altered. Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. Land use is an economic activity that generates large benefits for human society. One side effect, however, is that it has caused many environmental problems throughout history and still does today. Biodiversity, in particular, has been negatively in-fluenced by intensive agriculture, forestry and the increase in urban areas and infrastructure. Integrated assessment such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), thus, incorporate impacts on biodiversity. The main objective of this paper is to develop generic characterization factors for land use types using empirical information on species diversity from Central Europe, which can be used in the assessment method developed in the first part of this series of paper. Methods. Based on an extensive meta-analysis, with information about species diversity on 5581 sample plots, we calculated characterization factors for 53 land use types and six intensity classes. The typology is based on the CORINE Plus classification. We took information on the standardized α -diversity of plants, moss and mollusks into account. In addition, threatened plants were considered. Linear and nonlinear mod-els were used for the calculation of damage potentials ( EDP S ). In our approach, we use the current mean species number in the region as a reference, because this determines whether specific land use types hold more or less species diversity per area. The damage potential calculated here is endpoint oriented. The corresponding characterization factors EDP S can be used in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment as weighting factors for different types of land occupation and land use change as described in Part 1 of this paper series. Discussion. Land use has severe impacts on the environment. The eco- system damage potential EDP S is based on assessment of impacts of land use on species diversity. We clearly base EDP S factors on α -diver- sity, which correlates with the local aspect of species diversity of land use types. Based on an extensive meta-analysis of biologists' field re- search, we were able to include data on the diversity of plant species, threatened plant species, moss and mollusks in the EDP S . The integra- tion of other animal species groups (e.g. insects, birds, mammals, am-phibians) with their specific habitat preferences could change the char- acterization factors values specific for each land use type. Those mobile species groups support ecosystem functions, because they provide func- tional links between habitats in the landscape. Conclusions. The use of generic characterization factors in Life Cycle Impact Assessment of land use, which we have developed, can improve the basis for decision-making in industry and other organizations. It can best be applied for marginal land use decisions. However, if the goal and scope of an LCA requires it this generic assessment can be complemented with a site-dependent assessment. Recommendations and Perspectives. We recommend utilizing the devel- oped characterization factors for land use in Central Europe and as a reference methodology for other regions. In order to assess the impacts of land use in other regions it would be necessary to sample empirical data on species diversity and to develop region specific characterization fac- tors on a worldwide basis in LCA. This is because species diversity and the impact of land use on it can very much differ from region to region.","Integrating stakeholder values into the process of quantifying impairment of ecosystem functions is an important aspect of watershed assessment and planning. This study develops a classification and prioritization model to assess potential impairment in watersheds. A systematic evaluation of a broad set of abiotic, biotic, and human indicators of watershed structure and function was used to identify the level of degradation at a subbasin scale. Agencies and communities can use the method to effectively target and allocate resources to areas of greatest restoration need. The watershed performance measure (WPM) developed in this study is composed of three major components: (1) hydrologic processes (water quantity and quality), (2) biodiversity at a species scale (core and priority habitat for rare and endangered species and species richness) and landscape scale (impacts of fragmentation), and (3) urban impacts as assessed in the built environment (effective impervious area) and population effects (densities and density of toxic waste sites). Simulation modeling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), monitoring information, and spatial analysis with GIS were used to assess each criterion in developing this model. Weights for attributes of potential impairment were determined through the use of the attribute prioritization procedure with a panel of expert stakeholders. This procedure uses preselected attributes and corresponding stakeholder values and is data intensive. The model was applied to all subbasins of the Chicopee River Watershed of western Massachusetts, an area with a mixture of rural, heavily forested lands, suburban, and urbanized areas. Highly impaired subbasins in one community were identified using this methodology and evaluated for principal forms of degradation and potential restoration policies and BMPs. This attribute‐based prioritization method could be used in identifying baselines, prioritization policies, and adaptive community planning.","The diagnosis of soil pollution in relation to the most commonly used remediation methods is an innovative way of tackling this problem. To this end, the theoretical framework of Ecosystems Health has been instrumental, since this area is presently emerging as a new language for general discourse on pollution. For example, the use of the term stressor for a pollutant implies the study of behavior responses in living organisms (at different levels of organization, from the cell to ecosystem) both in terms of impacts (toxicity) and tolerance towards the pollutant (their adaptation). Two very common scenarios in the central Iberian Peninsula have allowed us to approach the understanding of this area of study: (i) old abandoned mines and, (ii) old solid waste (urban and industrial) landfills. The soils of these systems are mainly polluted with heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd), they overlie different lithological substrates (granites, limestones and especially arkoses), and are highly representative of soils of the Mediterranean region (mainly regosols, luvisols and cambisols). The landfills of the mines or waste tips have slopes exceeding 40%, such that any leachates produced transfer pollutants to adjacent ecosystems at lower altitudes (stream bed pastures, marshes and surface water courses). Moreover, since the topsoil layer is usually sandy with low proportions of clay and organic matter, deep leachates also transport pollutants to ground water systems. We focused on the autotrophic component of the affected ecosystems for several reasons: toxicity tests could be used to examine the physiological and behavioral responses of organisms (mortality, injury, metabolic changes) as well as population (population density, risk of extinction) or community (structure, diversity, biomass, nutrient flow changes) variables. The build-up of a heavy metal in the above-ground part of a plant (phytoaccumulation) consumed by herbivores is also detrimental for health, due to transfer to the trophic network. Root systems may play a role in phytostabilizing heavy metals and in preventing them from passing to deeper soil layers. Finally, given the erosion problems of fine materials in landfills and waste tip slopes, vegetation helps avoid the movement of topsoil layer pollutants to other ecosystems. The methodological approaches validated by results obtained over the last twenty years can be summarized as: studies of polluted sites based on phytoecological sampling, analysis of soil chemical and physical properties, georeferencing of the heavy metals they contain for further sampling in areas showing the highest levels, collecting and chemically analyzing plants at these sites, and the use of soils with their seed banks to perform experiments in microcosms in controlled conditions. The idea is to use a combination of field and laboratory methods that simulate real scenarios in which soil pollution occurs. INTRODUCTION: THE COMPLEXITY OF DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE With the title “From Biodiversity to Biocomplexity”, the monograph of the June 2001 issue of BioScience was devoted to the multidisciplinary step we need to take if we are to understand our environment. The main questions addressed as challenges for biologists at this start of a century are perfectly apt to introduce the subject of the work we describe in this chapter. There is no question that the field of biocomplexity will be in the forefront of research endeavors in the years to come, given it is a property of all ecosystems; or in other words, it is the thread that links many complex systems that are structured or influenced by living organisms, their components or biological processes. Interactions between live beings and all the facets of their external environment are an evident fact and research into these interactions, which involve multiple levels of biological organization and/or several spatial or temporal scales, is of great importance for everything related to environmental impacts. To undertake such research, long term data collection and monitoring are required to examine interactions at different spatial scales of the landscape and assess interplay between air, soil, water and the ecosystems they sustain. These issues will guide decision-making and help understand the functions of ecosystems and the changes they suffer in an ever-evolving world. Notwithstanding, the study of complex systems, among which we can include terrestrial ecosystems at polluted sites, is in large measure at a very early stage. Analyzing the individual components of a system offers no information about the properties of its combined components. The emergence of new properties when components change is a common phenomenon, but deciphering what makes new features emerge is a topic that has only just started to attract the attention of scientists. With these brief considerations only, we can begin to understand the current impact that the topic of restoring degraded ecosystems is having for biologists because of its complex nature. Biocomplexity is nevertheless difficult to describe and experimentally assess owing to its non-linear nature. Indeed, understanding biological complexity requires the development of new paradigms that cross temporal, spatial and conceptual barriers. Certainly, in the journal mentioned it is recognized that the development of the ecosystemic focus and its use to try to understand and resolve environmental problems, has been one of the major advances of Biology in the past 50 years. For many years now this has been our approach (Hernandez, 1989 and 1991) and in the subsequent sections of this chapter we describe some of the concepts we have established and tested to address the subject of restoring degraded ecosystems. Remediating and recovering degraded ecosystems is really a topic of systemic reality. This dictates a need to juggle the basic principles of systems analysis (complexity, interaction, uncertainty, multicausality) in an episystemic focus on ecological restoration. The applicability of this focus stems from the fact that ecosystems are dynamic systems that evolve and coevolve with human activity, though always evoking their stability, a term frequently used in relation to the response of an ecosystem to perturbation. This in reality is the picture we are faced with: both EU community policies and global warming that affect the dynamics of abandoned cereal fields or grassland systems, along with the environmental impacts of new emerging systems in structured landscapes such as landfills. The remediation of landscapes by reforesting with tree species is met with changes in soil structure, a feature not usually considered in practice that complicates the system to be restored. In the case of solid waste landfills capped with soils taken from surrounding areas, we have to face the complexity that arises from the secondary ecological succession, arising from the seed bank of the covering soil, intermixing with the primary succession of these new ecosystems. Not only does the impact of waste disposal need restoring but the “waste system” itself also needs to be remediated.","A decline in Northwest Arkansas's native plalll population has occurred over the past 50 years, as documemed by the U.S. Forest Service in the O:ark-Ouachita Highlands Asseumellt. This decline has been caused by increased human del•elopment in natural areas and the replacement of native plants with exotic, non-native plant.s. As a result, a generation has grown up not knowing what an Ozark wake Robin trillium (Trillium pusillum var. ozarkanum) or Blood root (Sanguinaria canadensis) Look like, because these plants are difficult to find in nature, are not commonly grown in designed landscapes, and are Largely unavailable in garden centers. The loss of Arkansas's native plants ha.v led to a second problem: the lo.n of the region's landscape identity. A proposed sollltionfocuses on restoring the region's Landscape identity b} Landscaping with native plants. The benefits of native plants include the following: the creation ofnative habitats. an increase in biodiversity, the conservation ofnatural resources, a reduction in long-term landscape costs and a decrease in Landscape maintenance requirements and costs. Interviews with regional suppliers and users of nath·e plants idemified wurces of information and methods of growing these plants. As a result, guidelines on how to incorporate native pla/1/s into designed landscapes were developed and are prese11ted with a listing of native plant experts and nurseries, a partial listing of plwztsfor Northwest Arkansas (organized by site conditions), a suggested reading and reference list, and a listing of public gardens that emphasize native plants. Problem: In this project two related problems were identified in Northwest Arkansas: the loss of natural area~ due to increased population growth and development and the loss of the region'~ landscape identity. Industnal, commercial and residential construction is on the rise in Northwest Arkansas. Lands that were previously undeveloped arc rapidly becoming developed, resulting in a loss of natural habitats. This is followed by the replacement of preexisting native plants with commonly available non-native plants, thereby resulting in loss of the region's native landscape identity. Methods: lnfonnation was gathered by a review of literature, personal interviews with native plant experts, data collection from the native plant questionnaire, and from native plant workshop~. This research clarified the problems and proposed solutions. It also suggested methods of data collection and analysis. Goal of Project: The goal of this project wa~ to study the use of native plants tn designed landscapes in Northwest Arkansas. Obstacles: A lack of knowledge about local native plants is the largest obstacle in the use of native plants. Many homeowners, and even landscape designers, lack the horticultural knowledge to make optimum plant choices and are easily influenced by the generic, non-native offerings of plant!'. available through local nur·series or catalogs. Another ob.,taclc to ll',ing native plants is the crcauon of a standard concept of aesthetics for American landscapes. This phenomenon of lwmogeni::atio11 is occurring thorough out the United State~. \"Somehow we have arri\\ ed at the point in v.hich homogenitattOn and monotony arc called 'aesthetically plea.,ing' and not cutting the lawn is called 'unAmcrican.' \" 1 The last obstacle that -.tand'&gt; tn the v. ay of native 1 Coleman: Native Plants: The Preservation and Restoration of Native Plants Published by ScholarWorks@UARK, 2002 6 INQUIRY Volume 3 2002 plant usage is the lack of local resources and the associated high cost of native plants. However, this is changing as more native plant nurseries enter the market.2 Proposed Solution: To use native plants in designed landscapes instead of commonly available non-native plants. Benefits: Psychologists Stephen and Rachel Kaplan have clearly documented throughout their 20 years of research that humans have lower stress levels and improved quality of life if they live and/or work near natural settings.3 Books they have written on this subject include the following: Humanscape: Environments Are For People and With People In Mind: Design and Management For Everyday Nature. The benefits of natural environments are related to other living things as well. Native plants and their communities are the foundation of natural habitats. In addition, native plants provide a framework of associations that other living creatures can then build upon. The more species living within an ecosystem, the higher its productivity and the greater its ability to withstand drought and other kinds of environmental stress. Since we depend upon an abundance of functioning ecosystems to cleanse our water, enrich our soil, and manufacture the very air we breathe, biodiversity is clearly not an inheritance to be discarded carelessly [however] biodiversity is our most valuable but least appreciated natural resource. There have been numerous studies done that clearly demonstrate that loss of habitat directly correlates to declining numbers of insects, birds and other forms of wildlife. Scientists have documented alarming declines in the number of songbirds, \"warblers, vireos, flycatchers, and thrushes have declined by 50 percent or more in the past few decades.\"5 According to associate director of conservation for the National Audubon Society, Vincent Muehter, \"the number one reason for the declining bird population is habitatdegradation\"6 In addition, many of the nonnative plants that are commonly planted do not provide adequate habitats for local wildlife. Author Sara Stein so aptly suggests, \"Remove a pheasant's cover or the butterfly's flower and you have erased its space.\"7 Native plants in designed landscapes also decrease the amount of time and energy required to maintain that landscape, thereby saving natural resources. Once established, most native plants do not require herbicides or pesticides, nor extra water or fertilizer, and they need only occasional mowing or pruning. The Preservation of Regional Landscape: Gardening with native plants serves as a link to the regional landscape and fosters a true sense of place, \"something that is missing from most of our homogenized, look-alike landscapes. \"8 The sense of place of Northwest Arkansas is threatened because of the rapid growth that has occurred in recent years. University of Georgia, Landscape Architecture Professor, Darrel Morrison proposes to solve this problem \"by utilizing patterns and processes that are intrinsic to naturally evolved landscapes, we can create designed and managed landscapes that are clearly of the place and that approach the ideal of sustainability.''9 The identity of a place, like Northwest Arkansas, is defined by its geology, terrain, climate, soil conditions, native vegetation and wildlife. This knowledge is necessary to design a landscape using native plants. Questionnaire: Fourteen (local and national) native plants people were interviewed ranging from residential homeowners to nurserymen to professors in horticulture and landscape architecture. As a result, their experiences related to native plants varied significantly. However, a common factor was an overriding desire to promote the use of native plants, because they promote a sense of place, often cost the same as non-native plants, and native plants are typically easier and cheaper to maintain Guidelines for Starting a Native Plant Garden: It is recommended that interested persons read books and journals on the subjects of garden design, garden installation and maintenance, native plants and plant communities. Local lists of regional suppliers and sources should be gathered. To begin the plan obtain the lot dimensions and draw a base map of the site. Complete an inventory of the existing site including all features and document the findings. Make a wish list of the desired elements and features. The design should consider the type of setting that the site is located in (rural, suburban, urban), the natural characteristics of the site, the information derived from the site inventory, the desired formality of the design, items from the wish list, the available finances and time that can be invested into the project. The design of the garden can be naturalistic or formal as native plants can be used in either setting. Conclusions and Recommendations: This project supports the use of native plants in designed landscapes to promote the over all health of the planet and its human inhabitants. This information was based on the literature search and was expanded by interviewing suppliers and users of native plants. As a result. guidelines on how to incorporate native plants into designed landscapes were developed. A listing of local and national experts and nurseries, a partial listing of native plants for Northwest Arkansas (organized by site conditions), a suggested reading list, and a listing of public gardens that emphasize native plants, are available from the author. Future recommendations to further the discussion on native plant use in Northwest Arkansas include informal discussions at 2 Inquiry: The University of Arkansas Undergraduate Research Journal, Vol. 3 [2002], Art. 5 http://scholarworks.uark.edu/inquiry/vol3/iss1/5 LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE: Janet Coleman Native Plants 7 local venues, a continuation of native plant workshops, the development of a Web site and future research projects related to the use of native plants in designed landscapes that create specific habitat types.

Native ferns: Sci","Human-dominated landscapes often have habitat loss and fragmentation. These characteristics described at the landscape scale, called landscape elements, influence species diversity and distribution. These landscape elements include such descriptions as the amount of habitat in the landscape and the degree of fragmentation of the habitat. “Optimization of landscape pattern” studies which landscape elements will maximize species diversity and/or distribution. Some general conclusions have emerged from this research. For example, for some bird species the size of the habitat patch in which a species nests has been found to be more important than landscape variables. However, preliminary research suggested that landscape elements such as the matrix are important urban areas. My study addressed this problem by asking: which elements of the landscape are most important for predicting avian species richness and abundance in the Greater Toronto Area? A literature review revealed a number of variables that have been found to influence bird species diversity within a landscape: area of habitat in which the species nests, amount of habitat within the landscape, degree of fragmentation, vegetation characteristics of the habitat patch, and area within the landscape deemed urban in municipal landuse designations (amount of urbanization). From this literature, I formulated four hypotheses describing the most important variables for avian diversity: (1) the area of the habitat patch is most important, (2) only variables describing the habitat patch itself are important, (3) the area of the habitat patch is important, but landscape variables should also be considered and (4) urbanization is most important. These hypotheses were considered competing explanations of bird species diversity at the landscape scale. A database of breeding bird data and landscape information, in a geographic information system platform, was used to investigate the comparative strength of the competing hypotheses for the Greater Toronto Area. A mathematical expression with a Poisson model format was created to represent each hypothesis. The model selection technique based on Kullback-Leibler information using the Akaike Information Criterion was deemed most appropriate for the comparison of the models. Four separate Poisson model competitions were completed using two habitat types and two response variables: species richness and total abundance. In three of the four competitions, the best model included the habitat area and the amount of urbanization in the landscape. In the forth competition, this model was considered as strong as another model which included habitat area, amount of habitat in the landscape and degree of fragmentation. The results from the model competition support the hypothesis that habitat area is important, but landscape variables must also be considered to explain avian richness and total abundance. It appears that maintaining native bird biodiversity in the Greater Toronto Area should focus on preserving and possibly increasing habitat area and decreasing adjacent urbanization. Exploration of the best model in the forest analysis with the richness response variable found that a 10% increase in habitat area cause approximately a 10% increase in species richness, and a 10% increase in urban","The work establishes the ecological importance of shale bings at both a local and global scale by presenting the mechanisms and processes of succession. The bings are postindustrial spoil heaps, the result of retorting mineral oil from deep-mined carboniferous shale beds. The structure of vegetation on the shale bings was determined by a review of published data and a base-line survey of eight bings resulting in new floristic and environmental data from 340 quadrats and 261 plant species. The floristic data were analysed in the context of ecological indicator values (Ellenberg), functional type (competitive, stress-tolerant, ruderal), National Vegetation Classification and two-way indicator species analysis. The results indicated considerable variation in plant communities both between and within different bing sites. The vegetation patterns were associated with the physical (altitude, aspect, slope and bare ground) and chemical (pH, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and nitrogen) environment of the shale substrate. Multivariate analyses (Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) were used to ascertain the amount of species variation explained by each of the different environmental gradients. Although these abiotic enviromnental factors were shown to have a statistically significant influence on the plant community structure around 75% of the variation was still unaccounted for. Nine species were selected to determine whether inherent plasticity within a species (plant height, number of flowering heads and seeds produced), the influences of seed dynamics and plant physiology could account for the variation in community structure not explained by environmental variables. This showed that almost half of the variation between and within bing sites was stochastic and probably dependent on the chance arrival of propagules in the initial stages of succession. The results from this study were compared and contrasted with theoretical successional models and with similar studies of primary successions on both natural (glaciers, sand dunes, islands in fresh water, coral islands and volcanoes) and man-made (china clay, coal, other post-industrial sites, urban waste and arable land) sites. The similarities established the relevance of the work to other regions and sites, to successional theory and to ecological restoration and management practices. On a local scale the bings are shown to have high ecological importance. They are refugia for locally rare fauna and flora and are a major component of the West Lothian biodiversity action plans. They are also of considerable social and historic importance.","The advent of modern technology in agriculture has increased the efficiency of our food production but also poses pressures on the sustainability of our planet. The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been developed to safeguard traditional agricultural systems of global importance, which harnesses the harmonious relationship between people and nature. First launched in the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 to address the sustainable development of family agriculture and traditional farming practices for developing countries, it now has 59 sites located in 22 different countries as of March 2020. Despite almost two decades of its implementation, FAO has not set any requirements nor given guidance on monitoring of the conservation of GIAHS, but leaves it to the discretion of each GIAHS site to conduct voluntary self-evaluation. This study is a comprehensive review of all 11 GIAHS application proposals in Japan, which aims to (1) conduct characteristic analysis to identify elements and perspectives related to the GIAHS selection criteria, (2) understand the motivations and socioeconomic conditions, including challenges and opportunities related to the GIAHS application, so as to (3) propose a set of indicators and perspectives to address these challenges and opportunities for improving the application, monitoring, and management of the GIAHS. The study finds that motivations for applying to GIAHS designation are primarily driven by push factors of abandonment of traditional farming practices and farmlands and underuse of farming resources resulting from Japan’s decreasing and aging rural population, as well as the pull factor of biodiversity conservation. The importance of continuing traditional farming practices, cultural heritage, and involvement of various stakeholders are emphasized against the background of an aging farming population, rural-urban migration, youth exodus, poor maintenance of farmlands, and transferring traditional and local knowledge. By identifying the drivers of change and understanding the current socioeconomic conditions of the agricultural heritage systems in Japan as portrayed in the GIAHS application proposals, the study has clarified the strengths and challenges of the sustainability of these systems. Based on the analysis, the study proposes a comprehensive set of indicators to be considered when developing the GIAHS proposals and for updating the action plan for monitoring and managing the GIAHS sites. It is expected that the findings and recommended indicators will contribute not only in the improvement of the information integrity of future GIAHS proposals, but also as reference for the development and monitoring of GIAHS conservation action plans.","This very nice book presents a general picture of the multifaceted notion of ‘‘the Andes.’’ It is organized on the basis of a good old Humboldtian geographical tradition that remains unbeaten despite its age: By joining together increasingly fragmented and often disconnected published bits and pieces of research on the Andes, the book gives its readers an idea of how inspiringly attractive science can become when we get a chance to look at the ‘‘whole picture.’’ The authors carefully assemble the whole picture of the Andes by reconstructing the main features of past and present factors shaping nature–society relationships, and give important hints on how this all relates to future development challenges. From the beginning, the wellknown and highly recognized authors make it clear that ‘‘the Andes’’ today cannot be understood in terms of a mountainous region strictly defined by altitude or any other biophysical indicator. Rather, ‘‘the Andes’’ are a starting point for acknowledging the manifold entanglements of mountain regions with their surrounding lowlands or coastal areas. This view of the Andes as a network seems also to have guided organization of the book’s chapters. Although it moves from a presentation of biophysical factors, processes, and spaces to cultural, demographic, economic, and political aspects, there is no hierarchy between the different perspectives. The book’s organization thus matches a ‘‘modern’’ understanding of nature–society relationships in terms of coevolution. The book also shows that this ‘‘modern’’ understanding of nature–society relationships benefits from the ‘‘old’’ Humboldtian integrative and transdisciplinary geographical tradition. This provides a very good basis for processing fragmented scientific insights further towards understanding the potentials and limitations that shape the future development of the Andes. The introductory chapter presents an excellent overview of one of the most impressive features of the Andes: diversity in all its biophysical, socioeconomic, and cultural dimensions. It concludes by asking whether the region’s great socioecological diversity is a potential or a handicap for development. The authors suggest that the type of development does not depend on the region’s geography as such (geodeterminism): Whether a country is poor or rich depends on the degree to which its societies are able to regulate or ‘‘domesticate’’ the different phases of capitalist economic development towards the public good, rather than directing ‘‘development’’ profit maximization into private or public corporations. Chapter 2 contains inspiring insights into the complexity of biophysical factors and processes related to the highly diverse natural patchwork of Andean spaces. The last part of this chapter deals with natural risks, thus linking up nicely with the human side of Andean geography, which is addressed from Chapter 3 onwards. Based on well-documented examples of protected areas, this chapter shows how close so-called ‘‘traditional’’ indigenous and local forms of resource appropriation are to modern ways of conserving biodiversity. Instead of building on the globally dominant ‘‘fortress approaches’’— which see human beings as the main enemies of biodiversity—both indigenous and modern approaches are struggling for recognition that even if it seems more complex, a combined approach of enhancing biological diversity via the promotion of cultural diversity is a more sustainable way of organizing nature–society relationships in the long run. Chapters 4 and 5 provide a deeper understanding of the extremely rich cultural diversity of the societies living in the Andes. It is clearly shown that ‘‘Andean culture’’ is not just an undefined epiphenomenon of otherwise ‘‘westernized’’ people; culture has to be understood as a process that constitutes one of the main political resources through which Andean people re-create principles of development that underpinned their ancestors’ lives in the past, as a basis for orienting themselves in search of their own place in today’s global societies. Chapters 6 to 8 cover important issues regarding the coevolutionary process of emergence and the main features of today’s rural and urban housing structures, as well as their intimate relationships with key economic sectors and activities and the related transport infrastructure. Chapters 9 and 10 provide very useful insights into what the previously presented and illustrated characteristics of the Andes mean for understanding, and acting upon, the political–geographical overall conditions and their manifestations at the level of nation-states; consideration is also given to the different ways in which these states adopt the roles of victims and actors of ‘‘globalization.’’ Chapter 10 concludes with a highly relevant overview of the main economic, social, political, cultural, and ecological challenges for future development. It is precisely here that one weakness of this volume becomes more clearly visible. While the book does an excellent job of covering the ways in which the ups and downs of Andean history have been expressed in a dialectical process of colonization, resistance, and constant re-creation of identities, ecological places, and political organizations. These are increasingly taking on board their own values, derived from an innovative collective reconstruction of ‘‘our common past’’ as guidance for ‘‘our common future’’. While the book shows how this is expressed at local levels, the analysis of the political MountainMedia Mountain Research and Development (MRD) An international, peer-reviewed open access journal published by the International Mountain Society (IMS) www.mrd-journal.org","La lectura historica del territorio en relacion con el sistema agroalimentario aporta elementos claves para reconstruir el sistema territorial, aprovechando la oportunidad que ofrece un renovado interes por la alimentacion local y sostenible. El analisis historico transdisciplinar incorpora variables espaciales, economicas, energeticas, urbanisticas, agronomicas y nutricionales y se centra en el tramo medio del valle del Duero (Castilla y Leon, Espana). Se trata de un territorio tradicionalmente agricola, donde un producto de la tierra -el vino- es motor de innovacion y ha transformado paisajes y estructuras. Aun asi, se enfrenta a un desarrollo desigual e ilustra las contradicciones del mundo rural en un contexto alimentario globalizado. El analisis de la region desde 1900 permite constatar la relacion entre la organizacion del territorio, el sistema agroalimentario, y cada una de las etapas nutricionales: a) la superacion de la desnutricion esta asociada a una agricultura familiar y al territorio de proximidad, que persiste en la zona hasta 1950; b) el modelo de consumo de masas y sobrealimentacion, se basa en una agricultura industrializada y un territorio polarizado ligado al desarrollismo, que se extiende hasta 1985; c) finalmente, el modelo de consumo segmentado se apoya en una agricultura terciarizada y un territorio de enclaves en un contexto de globalizacion, que dura hasta nuestros dias. En la ultima fase aparecen nuevos modelos alternativos de reconstruccion territorial con sistemas emergentes que reconectan campo y ciudad, consumo y produccion desde sistemas de alimentacion sostenible. Conviven dos tendencias: una hacia la jerarquizacion y el productivismo tecnificado y otra hacia la multifuncionalidad y la recampesinizacion que se reapropia de las innovaciones tecnicas. La adaptacion a las condiciones locales y aprovechar los recursos endogenos son elementos clave de sostenibilidad ambiental y social. Incorporar la alimentacion en la planificacion urbana y territorial desde una perspectiva agroecologica reduciria la insostenibilidad del sistema alimentario. Las propuestas de ordenacion han de tener en cuenta la tipologia de municipios, sus interrelaciones, las caracteristicas agrologicas y productivas, la relacion del muncipcon los nucleos de referencia y con las poblaciones que concentran las necesidades de alimentacion. Se debe considerar asimismo la disponiblidad de infraestructuras, de equipamientos y de capital humano y relacional para fijar cadena de valor local. La ordenacion urbanistica cuenta ya con mecanismos como la clasificacion del suelo, la regulacion de usos y el diseno de redes de equipamientos que inciden sobre la autonomia de los sistema de alimentacion locales y permiten fomentar la biodiversidad y las variedades locales. Son mecanismos insuficientemente aprovechados. Una adecuada utilizacion de los instrumentos de ordenacion existentes, junto con el desarrollo de otros nuevos mejorarian de forma significativa la resiliencia de los sistemas agroalimentarios locales. ABSTRACT The historical review of the relationship between territory and agrifood system provides key lessons to help rebuild the territorial fabric, seizing the opportunity offered by a renewed interest in local and sustainable food. The historical transdisciplinary analysis spans spatial, economic, energy, agronomic and nutritional variables, focuses on the middle reaches of the Douro valley (Castilla y Leon, Spain). This a traditionally agricultural region, which has managed to turn a land product – the wine– into an engine of innovation which has transformed landscapes and structures. Even so, it faces the challenges of uneven development and illustrates the contradictions of the rural world in a globalized context. After the analysis of the evolution of the region since 1900, it can be concluded that the territory has been organized over time according to three models of food system that are in turn linked to different nutritional stages: a) the nutritional stage of overcoming malnutrition is related to family agriculture and a territory of proximity, which persists in the studied area until 1950; b) the model of mass consumption and overeating, was built on an industrialized agriculture and a polarized territory with unhindered development, which runs until 1985; c) and, finally, the model of consumer segmentation associated with terciarized agriculture and enclave territories in the context of globalization, which lasts until present time. During this last stage new alternative models of small-scale territorial reconstruction appear, linked to emerging systems that, based on sustainable food systems, reconnect city and countryside, consumption and production. Actually two trends coexist: one towards hierarchisation and tech-based productivism, and another one towards multifunctionality and peasantization that reappropriates technical innovations. The adaptation to local conditions taking advantage of local resources is a key element of environmental and social sustainability. Integrating food into urban and regional planning from an agroecological perspective would help reduce the current unsustainability of the food system. Planning proposals for municipalities need to consider their typology, agrological characteristics, productive capacity, links to other municipalities, proximity to reference nodes and population concentrations with food demands that need to be met. Availability of infrastructure, facilities, as well as human and relational capital to establish and reinforce local value chains is another aspect to consider in planning proposals. Spatial and urban planning are already equipped with mechanisms, such as land classification and the design of facilities’ networks, that affect the autonomy and stability of local food systems and can support biodiversity and adoption of local varieties. We are, however, missing opportunities. An adequate use of existing planning tools and the development of new ones could significantly improve the resilience of local agrifood systems.","Although Europe contains many mountain ranges, most are shared by a rather small number of nation states. In recent decades, particular attention has been given to two ranges shared by a larger number of states that have recognized shared concerns: the Alps and the Carpathians. For both of these ranges, the governments of the concerned states have signed binding legal conventions, and scientists have created collaborative networks that have held regular meetings and developed and implemented research programs. These processes started earlier and are thus more developed in the Alps. In the postsocialist era, scientists working in the Carpathians have benefited from the experiences and support of their Alpine colleagues, political imperatives related to the implementation of the Carpathian Convention, and global initiatives such as the Mountain Research Initiative (MRI). The volume and diversity of research conducted in the Carpathians have grown very significantly. This substantial book begins with a short introduction by the editors, which briefly describes the biogeographical characteristics of the Carpathians, the two major sets of processes that followed privatization in the 1990s and 2000s (land abandonment/forest succession and urbanization/large-scale investment in tourism), challenges to regional cooperation, and the structure of the book. This is effectively the proceedings of the first Forum Carpaticum, held in Kraków in 2010 as an open meeting of the Science for the Carpathians (S4C) initiative established in 2008, as described in the second introductory chapter by Astrid Björnsen Gurung of the MRI. It is perhaps worth noting that, in 2012, S4C signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Interim Secretariat of the Carpathian Convention that gives S4C the status of “official partner” and aims to strengthen collaboration (Debarbieux et al 2014). The rest of the book comprises 44 chapters, from 3 to more than 20 pages in length, by more than 100 authors from 10 countries. They are divided into 4 parts, each starting with a useful introductory chapter by one of the editors that provides some context for the following chapters and briefly summarizes them. The 10 detailed chapters in Part 1 consider the abiotic environment, with papers on natural hazards, climate changes and their impacts, water chemistry, and monitoring of hydrotechnical structures. Part 2 addresses many aspects of forests, which cover twothirds of the area of the Carpathians, with significant challenges for their management deriving from past and ongoing interactions of diverse factors including changing policy and ownership regimes, air pollution, and climate change. The 11 detailed chapters describe silvicultural and forest characteristics and various aspects of management, including some prospective studies from Ukraine, where stakeholders’ perceptions of forest ecosystem services are also described. Part 3 is entitled “The human dimension” and includes 11 detailed chapters, 5 focusing on the cultural landscape and biodiversity, and 6 on tourism and industrial and urban development. Two of these concern study areas that are outside the Carpathians but are of relevance there, given commonalities with the region. Part 4 is entitled “Methods” and includes 11 chapters, of which the first 6 focus on data collection and preprocessing and the others on data analysis. Many remote sensing and GIS applications are covered. Overall, this book represents a snapshot of research in the Carpathians at a time when collaboration was becoming a reality; and the 2010 Forum Carpaticum has been followed by others in 2012 and 2014 (see www.forumcarpaticum.org). The editors are to be commended on their efforts in bringing this body of research to an international audience, although they could also have added to its value by using their introductory chapters to each part not only to summarize the chapters in it, but also to provide a literature review to put the chapters in the context of existing knowledge. In addition, given the range of topics included in the book, an index would have been very useful. Crucially, another outcome of the 2010 Forum Carpaticum was a research agenda for 2010–2015 (Kozak et al 2011), and a new one for 2015–2020 is in preparation. It is notable that the latter is expected to include a greater emphasis on social science issues. This represents an evolution from the strong emphasis on natural science at the beginning of the decade, of key importance given the ongoing changes in all aspects of the region’s socioecological systems.","Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) can inform adaptation policy and help in incorporating climate futures in planning. The literature on CCVA stem from a number of research paradigms (e.g., risk assessment, natural disaster management, urban planning), therefore making it difficult to extract major directions and methodologies from this body of work. A large number of assessments are based, partly or totally, on indicators which bring up specific methodological problems and constraints. In this paper, first, we discuss the most important methodological challenges facing indicator-based vulnerability assessment (IBVA) based on a set of key conceptual 2 papers in the field. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis of a representative sample of peer-reviewed IBVA studies, in order to identify how current research on IBVA is engaging with these challenges. We attempt to elicit major thematic and methodological trends in this corpus with specific focus on issues related to geographical and temporal scales, aggregation and nonlinearity. We find that health of ecosystems and biodiversity (28%), freshwater quantity and quality (14%) and public health (10%) have attracted the highest number of studies. Less than a third of the papers in our sample give some consideration to uncertainty and non-linearity. Assessments typically use aggregation methods that are based on the Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) despite the fact that IBVA rarely satisfies the theoretical requirements of this approach. A small percentage of studies critically scrutinize prevalent assessment methodologies or attempt to develop new ones, despite the raised questions in key theoretical papers about its methodological aspects. 1.0 INTRODUCTION In order to integrate climate change into strategic decision making and planning the dynamic interactions between humans and the ecological systems on which they depend need to be understood and knowledge about the processes generating vulnerability to climate change needs to be built 1. In the literature, this exercise is usually termed Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA). CCVA can help policymakers in identifying vulnerable “hot spots” and better allocating adaptation resources, better understanding structural weaknesses which make a given system vulnerable, monitoring the effects of adaptation measures or better communicating risk and justifying policy to the public 2-4. CCVA can be viewed as an analytical exercise whose goal is to assess the vulnerability of a valued attribute (e.g., health, safety, economic prosperity) of a social-ecological system (SES) (e.g., locality, community, economic sector, infrastructure and its users) to one or more climate-change-related hazards (e.g., heat waves, flood events, rise in sea levels). Here we understand SES as a set of interactions between a 'bio-geo-physical' unit and its associated social actors and institutions 5, 6 or as a coherent system of biophysical and social factors that interact regularly in a resilient, sustained manner 7. Given the wide variety of SESs (e.g., agricultural, marine, urban, sylvan) subject to a number of possible climatic stresses, the CCVA literature is highly diverse in terms of content. In addition, different approaches to assessment, quantitative and qualitative, have emerged. For example, so-called top-down approaches typically use output of Global Circulation Models (GCMs)","Simple Summary Large carnivores and husbandry practices are important contributors to biodiversity integrity. However, conflicts that may arise when carnivores and livestock share the same areas may undermine both carnivore conservation and the maintenance of husbandry activities. Through the revision of the existing literature regarding human–carnivore conflict at a European Union (EU) level, our work aimed to assess stakeholders’ perception towards large carnivores (bear and wolf). The results showed that those categories (i.e., rural inhabitants and hunters), which were affected the most by the presence of carnivores were those who showed the most negative attitude. We showed that direct experience with carnivores has led the opinion of certain categories to become more negative. Furthermore, we did not find differences in terms of degree of tolerance by comparing areas in which carnivores and humans have coexisted for centuries and areas in which carnivores were extirpated. In the light of carnivore population dynamics, we recommend monitoring changes in attitudes over time to define appropriate solutions aimed at mitigating carnivore impacts. Abstract Conflicts between large carnivores and human activities undermine both the maintenance of livestock practices as well as the conservation of carnivores across Europe. Because large carnivore management is driven by a common EU policy, the purpose of this research was to assess stakeholders’ perception towards bears and wolves at an EU level. We conducted a systematic search and subsequent analysis of 40 peer-reviewed studies collected from 1990 to September 2020 within Member States of the EU. Rural inhabitants and hunters exhibited the most negative attitude compared to urban inhabitants and conservationists, whose attitude was more positive. We showed that direct experience with predators as a consequence of ongoing re-colonization may have affected the degree of acceptance of certain categories and that the long-term coexistence between humans and carnivores does not necessarily imply increased tolerance. To encourage coexistence, we recommend monitoring changes in attitudes over time relative to carnivore population dynamics.","The aim of this work was the development of proposed basic guidelines for the implementation of architectural ecoenvolventes (green roofs and walls) as a tool for urban environmental management. To do an analysis of secondary information we were made from the review of articles indexed scientific journals, reviewing reports of events in the District Department of Environment of Bogota and regulations, concerning the implementation of green roofs and walls, which served as a basis to demonstrate the existence of limiting factors in the implementation of architectural ecoenvolventes in an urban context. Moreover, by using the method of tree problems, the cause-effect relationships existing between the identified limiting factors and underlying causes established, finding that the main problem has to do with the implementation of architectural ecoenvolventes inarticulately urban environmental management. Besides the causes that are related to the limiting factors and their consequences, both on biodiversity, quality of life and environmental sustainability of the urban system found.","Water Framework Directive, ecological status of freshwater ecosystems, physicochemical parameters, metals, macroinvertebrates, periphyton, bacterial community, flow cytometry Freshwater ecosystems have been suffering severe degradation and loss of biodiversity, caused by human disturbances such as agriculture, industry, mining, urban development and climate changes. Therefore, the European Union reached an agreement and implemented the Water Framework Directive (WFD), with the main goal of reach a good ecological status in all water bodies. However, WFD is very complex, methodologies are timeconsuming and costly. Thus, the main objective of this study is to develop a rapid and cost-effective approach, by studying the bacterial community composition by flow cytometry, as a complementary methodology to WFD. To achieve this, we study 3 sampling sites at Caima River along the seasons (winter, spring and summer), with different levels of environmental impacts (Nascenteriver sourcewith little impact, Bustelodownstream WWTP and Palhalexposed to mine drainage), applying first the WFD criteria and then multivariate analysis for macroinvertebrate, periphyton and bacteria communities. Physico-chemical, metals and bacteria samples were collected from the water column and sediment river bottom, showing that in all the parameters (with some exceptions) and metals the concentrations were higher in sediments. Results showed that not always the macroinvertebrate and periphyton communities were sensitive to an increased nutrient input, resulting in an ecological status higher than expected. On the other hand, community structure analysis for macroinvertebrates and periphyton was very discriminatory, associating high levels of nutrients and metals with more tolerant organisms in impacted sites, and sensitive organisms with high levels of dissolved oxygen corresponding to pristine environments. Bacteria community analysis revealed a clear separation of LNA and HNA bacteria in sediment according to the different environmental stress, being possible to dissociate the majority of the impacted sites from the clean sites, being HNA a good indicator of contamination. These results revealed that bacteria community in sediments has more reliable data about the impacts that a freshwater ecosystem can suffer. The discriminating power of bacteria community analyzed by FCM provided good responses, although, further investigations are needed to confirm the feasibility of this new method, as a complementary tool in the water quality assessment.","page: 21, 37, 39, 40 I’m PhD student at the PhD school of “Agrometeorology and Ecophysiology of Agricultural and Forestry Eco-Systems” at the University of Sassari, (Italy) Dept. of Science for Nature and Environmental Resources (DipNET) funded by Euro-Mediterranean Center for Climate Changes (CMCC). The Ph.D. course aims to provide a high qualification in the field of management of agricultural and forestry productive systems and in the conservation, protection and enhancement of natural resources. My PhD project is on the effects of nitrogen depositions on Mediterranean ecosystem with a focus on plant water relations and soil properties. Marzuoli, Riccardo (riccardo.marzuoli@unicatt.it) Catholic University of Brescia Abstract page: 28, 36, 38 The Environmental Physics and Ecophysiology research group of the Catholic University has been working since ten years on the following main research topics: 1) Micrometeorological measurements of gaseous pollutants, water and energy fluxes between biosphere and atmosphere. 2) Experiments in controlled environment (Open-Top Chambers) for evaluating the effects of ozone and other abiotic stresses (drought, nitrogen deposition, water salinity) on vegetation. 3) Measurements of greenhouse gases emissions from soil (CO2, N2O). The research group includes expertise in: Flux measurements with eddy covariance and gradient techniques (on crops, forests and seminatural vegetation). Assessments of ecophysiological effects of ozone and water stress on vegetation (crops and forests) in relation to photosynthesis, gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, yield and biomass reduction, foliar injury.

Matos, Paula (psmatos@fc.ul.pt) Centro de Biologia Ambiental, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa Abstract page: 2, 3, 24 My current scientific interests focus on the development of new tools to identify the first signs of environmental change, as this could be the key to prevent or ameliorate its effects on ecosystems and human society. It’s currently accepted that these early-warning indicators should be based on the overall response of ecosystems, reason why we’ve been focusing on lichen functional diversity, which is also an understudied group (main works focus on plants). To do so we’ve been studying the pattern of change of lichen functional diversity on ecotonal areas along climatic gradients in space in Mediterranean drylands, as surrogates of the temporal changing patterns expected to happen according to future climate change scenarios. We are also interested to see how to disentangle the effects of other global change drivers, in this context of climate change. We aim that this early-warning indicators of global change developed here in the drylands, can be applied worldwide, so we are also developing work on other ecotones along climatic gradients in other parts of the world. My research group evaluates structural and functional changes in plant communities in response to changes or disturbance, from ecophysiological studies and the isotopic signals, to the phenological and climatic changes, as an approach to scale up from plant to the community level. This approach is also complemented by the use of remote sensing tools, developed by our group, to upscale to the regional scale. This knowledge and the scientific principles of structure and functioning of ecosystems is used not only to develop earlywarning tools for global change, but also to develop ecological management processes and define a sustainable strategy for the ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems, as well as the use of biological organisms for monitoring the impact of pollution on environment and on ecosystem functioning. Mereu, Simone (simonemereu@uniss.it) University of Sassari Abstract page: 21, 37, 39, 40 The Laboratory of Agrometeorology and Ecophysiology, mainly focuses on the biogeochemical cycles and fire regimes in both agricultural and wooded Mediterranean ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycles are monitored and analysed using Eddy Covariance technology over three ecosystems: A vineyard, an Urban ecosystem and a coastal Mediterranean maquis. This last site runs since 2005, was part of the CarboEurope network and is a candidate for class II sites of the ICOS network. The lab is also a branch of the EuroMediterranean Center for Climate Change (CMCC) and thus research activities also focus on the modelling of impacts and adaptation strategies to climate change including changes in NPP, species distribution, agricultural water requirements, fire risk, and land use change. In 2012 we started collecting comprehensive data in the Coastal Mediterranean Maquis Eddy Covariance site aiming at: 1) partitioning the NEE fluxes in its different components (Soil CO2 effluxes, species specific photosynthesis and respiration rates, respiration and photosynthesis of the biological crust); 2) species specific WUE; 3) Spatial analysis of soil properties and soil meteorological variables. The Nitrogen addition experiment was also started in 2012 at the same site. In 2014 we joined the TreeDivNet network by establishing a diversity manipulation experiment with Mediterranean trees following the IDENT design (www.treedivnet.ugent.be/SiteIDENT.html). This experiment aims at identifying Functional Diversity effects on different ecosystem functions as NPP, Water Use Efficiency and Nutrient Cycle. Merino Ortega, José Á.

The objective of this group is to contribute to the understanding of key problems in functional biodiversity and plant ecological adaptation related with environmental and anthropogenic factors in different types of ecosystems. It aims at: (i) evaluating structural and functional changes in plant communities in response to changes or disturbance, including ecophysiological studies and the isotopic signals of C, N, O and H, as an approach to scale up from the plant to community level; (ii) using scientific principles of structure and functioning of ecosystems to develop ecological management processes and define a sustainable strategy for the ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems, as well as the use of biological organisms for monitoring the impact of pollution on environment and on ecosystem functioning. Ochoa-Hueso Raúl (R.OchoaHueso@uws.edu.au) University of Western Sydney Abstract page: 25 I have broad interests on the effects of human-induced global environmental change on ecosystem structure and functioning and the link between them. I am also interested on how these undesired negative impacts affect key ecosystem services such as above-ground and below-ground carbon storage.

ABSTRACT English version of abstract in font italics Urban gardens transform the environment, are able to restore biodiversity, provide more quality of life for citizens. Urban gardens are important elements that lead to urban sustainability, being beneficial to human health. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyse the benefits of urban gardens through human health therapies in promoting sustainability. For this purpose, a bibliometric analysis was conducted from a systematic search in the Scopus database. It was identified that research arises in the following fields of knowledge: Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Engineering, Medicine, Social Sciences and Veterinary Sciences. The results of the present work indicate that this area still lacks more detailed studies, but, at the same time, there are many therapeutic benefits of urban gardens in relation to the quality of life of people of all ages, whether elderly, disabled or with psychological disorders.","This study reviews the influence of the Environment Board in municipal spatial planning in the city of Malmo and aims to highlight improvements in the consultation process. The municipalities are responsible for planning how land and water resources are to be used and thus central in attaining a sustainable land use and urban planning. Development plans are created by The City Planning Office and the Environmental Board is one of the respondents when such plans are submitted for comments. Using consultation documents concerning zoning (detaljplaner in Swedish), planning programs (planprogram in Swedish) and dialogue memorandums (dialog-pm in Swedish) from 2009 to 2014, I conducted a content analysis. Interviews with personnel at the administrations, completed the study. I found that during 2009-2014, comments concerning reduction of noise and other disturbances were most common, followed by traffic and mobility issues,contaminated soils and buildings, water protection and stormwater management, and preservation and development of nature sites and green spaces. At the beginning of the period, disturbance and traffic issues were predominant, but towards the end, water protection and management as well as contaminated soils and buildings were also among the most frequently commented issues. The study highlights a need to clarify what issues officials at the Environment Department are expected to pursue in planning consultations and that the submitted remarks could be more concise. The proportion of the comments, that were fully or partially met, ranged between 67 % and 78 % per year during 2009-2014. The result indicate an increase in the Board’s overall influence, since a previous review. Opinions often concurred in how to obtain good living conditions, by for example reducing noise, contaminants and attaining good air quality. Comments aiming to preserve and develop natural areas, green spaces and biodiversity were least fulfilled, compared to the other categories.

It is based on the potential vegetation occurring on lake and pond margins, wetland fens and bogs, and fluvial surfaces along streams and rivers within Forest Service lands. Data used in the classification were collected from 1,650 field plots sampled across the three forests. This classification identifies 32 series separated into four physiognomic classes: coniferous forests, deciduous forests, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation. In addition, keys to the identification of 163 plant associations or community types are presented. The report includes detailed descriptions of the physical environment, geomorphology, ecosystem function, and management of each series. This classification supplements and expands information presented in upland forest plant association classifications previously completed for these three eastern Washington forests. It is a comprehensive summary of the aquatic, and wetland series and contributes to the understanding of ecosystems and their management in eastern Washington. shown to be a positive factor contributing to population growth in urban and rural areas characterized by proximity to public forest lands. Beyond this broad finding, however, little research has been conducted at an appropriate scale to be directly useful in forest management and planning decisions. Areas for further research are identified. assessment The intuitive explanation for why an economy grows or develops often involves the ways in which land (resources), labor, and capital inter-act. Here we review the literature for what is known about the different pathways for economic growth and development in resource-abundant regions. We discuss the effectiveness of the forest products industry as a determinant of economic development and how comparative advantages of different forest goods and services have changed. Much of our discussion is based on southeast Alaska where the development of a forest products industry was seen as offering potential economic opportunities that would increase the stability of local communities. The experience of the last several decades there suggests that a more comprehensive strategy than just the development of a timber industry is required to sustain economic growth. location-specific typically are based on the requirements of Biome-BGC, a widely used biogeochemical model that was originally param-eterized for the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Several other ecosystem models, including Century 5, Daycent, TEM, and PnET, also use some of the inputs described here. This database provides a compendium of ecophysiological data for the Pacific Northwest that will provide easily accessible information for particu-lar tree species, parameters, and ecosystems for application to simulation modeling. historical wildfire regimes resulting in increased wildfire severity in the Nation’s forests. The growing wildfire threat has motivated increasing interest in reducing hazardous fuels through prescribed burning, thinning, and harvesting. Debate about whether such fuel treatments are necessary persists owing in part to the complexity of the wildfire issue and to general disagree-ment among managers, policymakers, researchers, and citizens about whether long-term wildfire impacts and current trends present a real problem. Although scientific research continues to resolve many aspects of the wildfire issue, comprehensive economic analyses ex-amining the wisdom of investing in fuel treatments to reduce wildfire threat are lacking. This report presents one way of conceptualizing the costs and benefits of fuel treatments and wildfire and briefly reviews issues related to their evaluation. The intent is to enrich ongoing debate by organizing management and policy dialogue around a conceptual framework that character-izes the long-term impacts of fuel treatments on forest conditions and wildfires, within an analyti-cal context that includes both wildfire- and nonwildfire-related forest management activities. composition of high-hazard forests are significantly more effective at reducing hazard than thin-from-below approaches that remove smaller trees only. Trees removed as a byproduct of the restoration treatment yielded net revenues aver-aging over $600 per acre, whereas the thin-from-below treatment conditions were projected forward 30 years and reevaluated for hazard. Projections revealed that effectiveness of all treatments diminished over time; however, forests receiving the comprehensive restoration treatment maintained substantially lower hazard 30 years after treatment than they would have had they received the alternative treatments. initial state.

Data were collected as part of several statewide multiresource inventories, including those conducted by the Pacific Northwest Region (Region 6) on National Forest System lands in Oregon, by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on BLM lands in western Oregon, and by the Pacific Northwest Research Station Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program on BLM lands in eastern Oregon and state and private lands across Oregon. Statistical tables provide estimates of land area, timber volume, growth, mortality, and harvest for the state and half-state units (western and eastern Oregon). The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program collected, analyzed, and summarized field data on 46 forested plots on the island of Guam. Estimates of forest area, tree stem volume and biomass, the numbers of trees, tree damages, and the distribution of tree sizes were summarized for this statistical sample. Detailed tables and graphical highlights provide a summary of Guam’s forest resources and a baseline from which to detect future change following remeasurement of the permanent field plots. The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program of the Pacific Northwest Research Station collected, analyzed, and summarized data from field plots, and mapped land cover on four is-lands in American Samoa. This statistical sample provides estimates of forest area, stem volume, biomass, numbers of trees, damages to trees, and tree size distribution.

We assessed the influence of red alder on tree species composition, stand density, tree size distribution, tree mortality, and potential for producing large conifers in 38- to 42-year-old riparian forests along 13 headwater streams in the Maybeso and Harris watersheds on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. Red alder ranged from zero to 53 percent of the total live basal area of the stands. Tree density, basal area of live and dead trees, and mean diameter of live conifers were not significantly related to the percentage of alder as a proportion of the total stand live basal area within these riparian forests. The mean diameter of the 100 largest conifers per hectare was similar among different sites and seemed unrelated to the amount of alder in the stand. The mean diameter of dead conifers increased slightly with increasing proportion of red alder. Most dead trees were small and died standing. Red alder was much more concen-trated immediately along stream margins. The presence of red alder did not inhibit the production of large-diameter conifers, and both alder and conifers provided small woody debris for fishless headwater streams in southeastern Alaska. Red alder is an important structural component of young-growth riparian stands. 2003. Influence of on aquatic biodiversity. American Fisheries Society Symposium. 37: 249-263. Wood influences the full variety of life in aquatic and riparian areas, from genes and species to ecosystems and landscapes. We review the role of wood in mediating biodiversity in aquatic and riparian ecosystems, identifying the topics, types of diversity, taxonomic groups, and scales that have been studied and highlight gaps in existing knowledge. The components of biodiversity most frequently studied include species diversity (or richness) of macroinvertebrates and fishes, structural complexity within habitat units, and the diversity of habitats found within a stream reach. Many of these studies show that large wood increases biodiversity. The abundance of wood in channels and adjacent riparian zones, as well as its functional role, differs greatly in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions along the river corridor. The influence of wood on community structure and ecosystem processes also differs across these dimensions and from stream head-waters to river mouths and near-shore marine environments. Thus wood can influence biodiversity at all these scales. It","The proposed collaboration between Biolab and WARN-ID aims to develop a public health pathogen genomic surveillance and outbreak response system to help inform public health interventions during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in future epidemics. Biolab has publicly released 584 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The majority were resequenced and curated by our collaborators in the Andersen Lab at The Scripps Research Institute. Only select samples were sequenced in-house by Biolab owing to financial resource constraints and a lack of experience with the required bioinformatic pipelines, limiting our ability to undertake the large-scale next-generation sequencing required for sustainable in-country pathogen surveillance. This project aims to investigate the circulating and emerging diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan. The secondary aim is to establish a training platform to develop in-country next generation sequencing (NGS) capacity, equipping local scientists with the necessary bioinformatic skillset to process, analyze, and share pathogen sequence data. We will use a hypothesis-driven sampling framework to enrich our dataset with the viral genomes most likely to harbor genetic changes of epidemiological or clinical interest to maximize the informativeness of our proposed sample size of 500 genomes. The sampling framework will include (1) patients with recurring SARS-CoV-2 infections, (2) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite Spike antibody seropositivity, and (3) infected traveling foreigners and expats. The data generated will provide WARN-ID labs and the global genomic epidemiology community with valuable information to fill the gaps on the global circulating diversity of SARS-CoV-2, adding critical value to understanding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan and the Middle East. Abstract Pathogen emergence is generally initiated by spillover of a pathogen from wildlife into livestock or humans, which can occur in areas with high animal and arthropod biodiversity that act as bridge vectors, such as ticks. The Pantanal in Brazil is a critical scenario for this occurrence, as is the largest wetland in the world and a global biodiversity hotspot. The periodic flooding that characterizes the Pantanal habitat prevents major ecosystem modification, cattle and horses are ranched extensively at relatively low densities, enabling preservation and intermixing with the diverse wildlife and their ticks. We hypothesize that potential tick vectors co-occur with both wildlife and livestock within the Pantanal and thereby have the potential to affect spillover. To test this hypothesis, we will monitor the occurrence of wildlife, livestock, and ticks at replicate sites in the Pantanal across the project using a combination of camera traps, collection, and tick identification. The outputs of this analysis will be used to guide the targeted screening of a subset of individual ticks for particular arboviruses using next-generation sequencing. Climates and geographical location data will be analyzed in conjunction with remotely sensed abiotic variables to characterize environmental predictors of transmission risk posed by ticks to domestic species in this region. Machine learning on traits of collected ticks will be used to discern vector species and individual ticks and hosts that are most likely to be involved in the wildlife cycle of target pathogens, particularly arboviruses. The study benefits CREATE-NEO by expanding capacity for investigation of tick-borne viruses. Abstract Viet Nam sits within a critical Southeast Asian emerging infectious disease hotspot with diverse wildlife and a rapidly increasing human population. In this region, wildlife farming is a growing but inadequately regulated industry that exhibits many features thought to contribute to increased risks of cross-species transmission and zoonotic disease emergence. We will focus on a key zoonotic disease pathway that was involved in the emergence of Nipah virus, SARS-CoV, and potentially SARS-CoV-2—the spillover of viruses from wildlife to multispecies farms, and subsequently to people. We will test a key hypothesis: viral diversity and cross-species transmission will increase with species diversity on mixed-species farms, and this pattern will be further amplified by the presence of wildlife species. We will access a previously untouched sample set from 64 mixed-species farms in a biodiverse region of central Viet Nam where wildlife and domestic species are farmed both together and separately. We will characterize viral diversity in single- and mixed-species farms using metagenomics and PCR, identify their zoonotic potential using ecological and phylogenetic methods, and estimate risk of emergence by analyzing distribution and prevalence. To inform the local community of our results, we will develop a two-way dialog with farmers and government stakeholders in Viet Nam regarding potential disease risks associated with wildlife and mixed-species farming. Importantly, this project builds capacity for emerging infectious disease research in Southeast Asia by supporting the in-country development of analytically robust, hypothesis-driven research into the ecology and evolution of emerging infectious diseases. Abstract Recent outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV) have spread from the Amazon Basin into heavily populated southeastern Brazil. Despite this incursion into urbanized areas, to date, all human infections appear to result from spillover from infected non-human primates (NHPs). We hypothesize that recent yellow fever outbreaks reveal a previously unappreciated level of connection, via mosquitoes, between humans and NHPs in eastern Brazil, which may lead to a spillover of additional arboviruses. Our objectives are to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics and ecological drivers of YFV circulation in NHPs and investigate whether Mayaro virus (MAYV) also broke out in NHPs concurrently with the YFV outbreak. We will quantify active infection or previous exposure of free-living NHPs to YFV or MAYV by RT-PCR and neutralizing antibody assays, respectively. Then we will identify the biotic and abiotic drivers of viral infection using spatiotemporal statistical models, with local environmental factors and new host-level traits as explanatory variables. Our goals are to predict the possible hosts and geographic extent of YFV and MAYV transmission and dynamics. These findings will guide future efforts on viral surveillance. Health authorities could use our inferences to strengthen vaccination programs and prioritize surveillance and control strategies. The results could also be translated into modeling efforts on other enzootic viruses supporting public health decisions to prevent and cope with future outbreaks. The project will expand the PI’s research capacity for detecting viruses and identifying ecological drivers of viral transmission. Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in &gt;115 million infections with &gt;2.5 million deaths worldwide, yet Kenya has reported &lt;110,000 infections and &lt;2,000 deaths. A recent serosurvey conducted by the Centers for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases East and Central Africa (CREID-ECA) in Nairobi indicates that approximately 35% of the population in the capital city (&gt;1 million people) had been infected/exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by November 2020 yet this has not been accompanied by overwhelming reports of hospitalization or death. Protective humoral immunity that limits infection, dissemination, and transmission is thought to be critical in preventing development of severe disease; thus, individuals within Kenya may have unique humoral profiles that provide protection against severe disease. However, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission and immune evasion properties have threatened to undermine preexisting humoral immunity established prior to November 2020. Thus, in this Pilot Program, we propose to characterize antiviral humoral immunity that developed in Kenya throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March-November 2020) and determine if immunity is compromised in the context of emerging global and Kenyan/East Africa regional SARS-CoV-2 variants. We will analyze existing sera samples collected by CREID-ECA and the University of Nairobi for Fab-mediated neutralization and Fc-mediated innate immune effector functions using established Systems Serology and pseudo neutralization platforms. The proposed objectives will inform on the magnitude and quality of humoral immunity in the Kenyan population and determine if emerging variants are resistant to preexisting antibodies generated early in the pandemic Abstract Hantaviruses are widespread across the world and remain a threat to public health. They are maintained in the environment via persistent infection in reservoirs such as rodents and transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosols containing animal excreta. Data of hantavirus from South-East Asia remain scarce. In Cambodia, the presence of hantavirus in rodents was reported for the first time in 1998. In humans, data are still lacking and the burden of the disease remains unknown. The purposes of the study are (1) to develop and standardize serological and molecular tools for diagnosis and characterization of hantavirus; (2) to document the presence and diversity of hantaviruses among rodents in urban and rural areas of Cambodia; and (3) to study the prevalence of hantavirus infection in humans and identify factors associated with hantavirus infection or exposure. This is a retrospective study nested in the HEPAR project in which rodent and human samples have been collected from urban and rural areas of Cambodia. The study will be conducted in collaboration with various units of Institut Pasteur Paris, which is part of the Pasteur International Center for Research on Emerging Infectious Diseases. The proposed study will provide a wide range of diagnostic tools, a better understanding of","Urban socio-ecosystems can be defined according to sociological, economic, political, philosophic or historical criteria. For geologists, cities can also be considered as hydrological catchments subjected to biogeochemical cycles of elements, molecules and minerals that are produced, transported and deposited. In this case, most of the transfers are realized at the surface (for stormwater) and underground (for the stormwater and wastewater systems), and can be combined or separative. Materials deposited in sewer networks are considered as an issue for sediment management but, from a paleoenvironemental, they constitute potential archives for the Anthropocene (i.e since AD 1950; Zalasiewicz et al., 2015), allowing an integrated retro-observation of urban metabolism. Similarly, most materials that transit in sewer systems are considered as pollutants, but paleoenvironmentalists could use them as tracers for urban metabolism. Depending on the type of materials preserved in the sedimentary archives (drugs such as analgesics or antibiotics, illict drugs, alcohol residues, pesticides, hydrocarbons, specific molecular biomarkers…), the recent history of a large spectrum of thematics (health, food consumption, biodiversity, transport, energy…) could be reconstructed at the city scale, affording local authorities diagnostic tools for evaluating past public policies.In order to test whether paleoenvironmental approaches could be transposed to urban socio-ecosystems, we have analysed the sediments of short sedimentary cores drilled in a decantation tank located in Orleans (France; Figure 1). This decantation tank was built in 1942, is 17m deep and is presently saturated in sediments so that it does not properly filter sewer waters that are then directed towards wastewater treatment plants. To this respect, local authorities plan to clean out the tank and are undertaking various improvements. The tank is at the outlet of the sewer network that collects combined stormwater and wastewater over the whole hydrological catchment of Orleans and its suburb. A preliminary drilling afforded sedimentary sequences of maximum 1m length characterized by coarse grain silicoclastic deposits, sometimes sorted, interspaced with organic-rich layers (Figure 1). Some objects of evident anthropic origin could be distinguished such as a padlock, a coin dated back to 1999, and plastic and metallic residues of various origins. We also indentified in some layers grape and lemon seeds, and plant remains. XRF core scanner analyses performed on the whole cores revealed high levels of Zn, Pu and Cu all over the section, with organic layers being enriched. Ongoing work is focused on the analysis of “natural” and xenobiotic biomarkers that are studied through classical organic geochemistry analyses for natural biomarkers and through standard techniques employed in pollution studies for xenobiotics. The challenge, is off course, to transfer those techniques to a material of unprecented and extreme organic, elemental and mineral complexity. From the combined sedimentological, elemental and organic analyses, accompanied by radioelement dating, we will be able not only to discuss the nature of the materials (source, preservation…), but also the potential for these original archives to record the recent history of urban metabolism.","Environmental impact assessment is a tool to ensure the proper and correct implementation of a project, and it can be considered as a way to determine, predict and interpret the effects of a proposed project on the environment. In the process of assessing the effects of the environment, human judgments have always been effective in making decisions and with choosing the type of use or measuring the impact of developments on the environment. In the present study, the environmental effects of Khurshid Park have been investigated through the rapid impact assessment matrix (RIAM). The matrices have been scored by experts in this field and their results have been presented through Pastakia model formulas in the form of a range of quantitative and qualitative changes. The result is that the negative effects of the project in the construction and exploitation phases are especially evident on the biological environment, so the implementation of environmental management and monitoring program is necessary for the project, and if there is the decrease in theof negative effects of the project in the construction phase and given the positive effects of the project in the eExploitation phase, the project is feasible and will have positive and beneficial effects in the short and long term onin the region. At the end of the research, environmental observation suggestions and solutions are presented to reduce the negative effects of Khurshid Mountain Park Mountain. Keyword: Environmental Impact Assessment, Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM), Khurshid Park 1.Introduction The construction of the promenades will provide the ground for the tourism industry and will contribute significantly to the region's economy. The creation of any industry affects the environment of that the region, so environmental impact assessment can play an effective and important role in identifying the possible effects of developments on the environment and reducing environmental problems and participatingon in sustainable development (Monavari, 2008: 33). Environmental impact assessment is an important management tool for human use of the environment through a systematic and public process that is used to identify and design sustainable environmental development projects, programs, and plans (Tavakoli, 2017: 149), also as a planning tool, it identifies the possible positive and negative effects of a project on the environment and helps decision-makers to reject or accept a project by providing a reasoned basis (Parastar, 2012: 1). In this the current research, the desired area of Bustan Khurshidthe area under study is Khurshid Park, with an area of about 384 hectares is located in District 9 of Mashhad Municipality, which is being constructed -------------------*Corresponding author. mahditalebelm@yahoo.com in terms of location between the residential area south of the Vakilabad axis and the 75-meter beltway under construction. Topographically, the Khurshid Park has a variety of topographiesy and most of its lands are located on a slope of more than 30%. This park can play an important role in the development of tourism in Mashhad and meet responds to the service and welfare needs of its surrounding area. Construction and operation of such parks (Park Mountain) have potential effects and consequences such as water, soil, noise, air pollution, and the dangers of transporting harmful and dangerous substances. On the other hand, the use of land to create parks, numerous recreational spaces, and highways may conflict with the current uses of the environment, having and have a detrimental effect on neighboring ecosystems. Therefore, the development and improvement of the quality of life should be accompanied by environmental considerations. Before trying to find a solution to the problems created, such problems should be prevented as much as possible (Shariat, 2011: 115). OConsidering that one of the reasons why the environment has been misused by mankind is tourism and especially ecotourism. In fact, the negative effects of tourism on nature include air pollution because of the increase in traffic, water Creative City Design / Vol. 3, No. 1, 2020 / Saeedi Mofrad et al, Evaluation of the Environmental ... 66 pollution caused by leaving solid trash in the water by tourists or soil pollution triggered by the spread of garbage. Taking into account the importance of mountain parks and their adverse effects on the environment, the primary purpose of evaluating environmental effects is to eunsure of regard aboutthe observance of policies and assigned goals in the program and activities of a project in accordance with environmental terms, standards, laws and regulations of the government, and the intent of this study is to identify the important activities of Khurshid Park in the construction and exploitation phase to determine its disadvantageous effects and consequences on the natural environment (southwestern heights of Mashhad). Considering the environmental results effects, how would saidhow does the aforesaid project affect the environment, in case of being executed or not executedion or otherwise? Evaluating the effects of development is a way to show the negative and positive effects of a project and thus a tool for proper planning and optimal management. Regarding the implementation of construction projects that bring the environment in line with development, a program is needed to combine the possibility of implementing these projects with environmental considerations (Monavari, 2013: 58). 2. Theoretical Foundations 2.1 Environmental sSustainability tability With the occurrence emergence of environmental waste and the decline in the general standard of living of people, especially in urban communities over the past decade or two, the sustainable development approach has been raised as a topic of the last decade of the twentieth century by the United Nations and was has been determined as the twenty-first-century instruction at the international, regional and local levels. In other words, the principle of sustainability is emphasized in development plans and programs as a general goal; a goal that has no end and is continuous. The term sustainable development was first coined by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987. The commission focused on environmental issues in the process of economic development. The most accepted definition of sustainable development is given in the Brantland Report. According to this report, sustainable development is a development that recognizes the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs (Hatami Nejad, 2016: 50). Sustainable development emphasizes the creation of a dream society, superior to today's society, and strives to make it a reality for future generations. The sustainability process is multidimensional (Pourjafar et al., 2011: 26), which is based on three main principles: 1. Ecological sustainability: This principle is based on development by preserving basic environmental processes, biodiversity, and environmental protection. 2. Cultural and social sustainability: This principle emphasizes the control of people over their destiny during development.3. Economic sustainability: This principle emphasizes the optimal use of resources and their proper management as a way that future generations do not have problems (Mahmoudi and Majed, 2012: 44). 2.2 Environmental Impact Assessment Assessing the effects of development on the environment is now considered as a planning and decision-making tool that predicts the effects and consequences of project implementation on the environment. Environmental impact assessment is the process and method of reviews and formal studies to predict the effects of project activities and functions on the environment, human health, and social welfare, or in other words, the systematic identification and evaluation of the consequences effects of projects and programs and plans on physical, chemical, biological, cultural, economic and social components of the environment. (Yousefi et al., 2012: 2). The process of environmental impact assessment is established, in the first place, to help the proper sustainable development planning and then to expand existing development projects (Dastorani, 2009: 1). There are various methods for preparing an environmental impact assessment report for a plan or project, such as a matrix checklist, overlaying maps, and a systematic analysis method. Almost all of these methods are common in four basic stages, which include: understanding the project and its main activities in the implementation and operation stages, understanding the environment (physical, biological and socio-economic environment), evaluating and predicting the effects of the project on the features of the environment and managing the actions to reduce significant negative predictable impacts and which finally, implementing a the monitoring and management program should be implemented to reduce the negative effects (Bahrman; 2017: 129). Examination of the history of a selection of evaluation methods shows that so far, themore checklist, matrix, map overlay, and system analysis methods have been often used in project evaluation, and among them, the checklists and matrices due to their efficiency and comprehensiveness are known as the most common evaluation methods. In the matrix method, the types of project-related activities are set in one dimension and a list of environmental parameters (physical-biological, economic-social) that may be affected by the project implementation process is set in another dimension. Using this method, the consequences of all project activities in the relevant periods are identified and evaluated. (Dastorani, 2009: 1). Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a way to assess the environmental consequences of a decision to regulate and , implement policies and plans, or initiate dev","This essay explores the environmental challenges faced by urbanized and industrial areas, focusing on air pollution, water pollution, urban sprawl, and loss of biodiversity. The research methodology integrates a systematic literature review, statistical analysis, and critical analysis, drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from ecology, urban studies, and geography. The essay assesses the limitations of traditional approaches and proposes innovative interdisciplinary methods to address these environmental problems more effectively. By analyzing statistical data, the article characterizes the depth and scope of environmental issues in urbanized and industrial areas, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable solutions. The essay concludes that fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and embracing innovative thinking is critical for developing more sustainable and environmentally responsible urban landscapes, ensuring a harmonious future for both human societies and natural ecosystems.","This study was carried out to assess potential heavy metal contamination in the muscles of three commonly consumed fish species in Lake Lanao and to determine associated health risks that may endanger local community residents who consume these fishes. The concentrations of Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Mercury (Hg) and Lead (Pb) were assessed in the muscles of Glossogobius giurus, Oreochromis niloticus and Giuris margaritacea and were measured via atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Statistical analysis showed that heavy metal concentrations in the muscles of the three fish species collected from the two different locations in the lake are not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) except for O. niloticus. Recorded amounts of the five heavy metals in the present study were lower than the maximum and standard levels except for Pb. Four (As, Cd, Cr, and Hg) among the five pollutants of concern obtained Non-carcinogenic Hazard Quotient (NHQ) values that are less than one, while NHQ values for Pb range between 815.6 and 1396.03 for all fish samples obtained from both sampling stations. The continued consumption of G. giuris, O. niloticus and G. margaritacea collected from Marawi City and Tugaya, Lanao del Sur posed a high likelihood for local residents to contract adverse non-carcinogenic impacts, specifically by Pb. This does not necessarily hold true for the whole of Lake Lanao however, due to limitations related to representativeness. Steps should be taken to manage the risks posed by the consumption of G. giuris, O. niloticus, and G. margaritacea from Marawi City and Tugaya, Lanao del Sur, especially in consideration of vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women and their developing fetus, and people with existing health conditions. 2 Jalova Jr. et al. 2021 The Israeli Journal of Aquaculture – Bamidgeh • IJA.73.2021.1426167 Introduction Lakes are essential to human well-being. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services including flood control, biodiversity, climate change mitigation, river flow regulation, hydropower supply, as well as water purification and storage. In recent decades, emerging global threats closely linked to anthropogenic pressures such as land-use intensification, nutrient enrichment, hydrological modification, aquaculture and fisheries, climate change, and water depletion have been driving forces of changes in lakes and reservoirs. These pressures have caused habitat loss and degradation, eutrophication and pollution, food web alteration, and physical degradation in many inland bodies. Another emerging threat to lake sustainability is the ever-increasing number of emerging contaminants brought about by technological advances which add more waste products and chemicals into the environment. These contaminants are new compounds with little environmental regulation and whose impacts are still not completely clear. They range from personal care products and illicit drugs to endocrine disrupting compounds, which can pose a serious threat to both aquatic ecosystems and human health. Additionally, the presence of micro-plastics and anti-microbial resistance in lakes are increasing because of the widespread use of these products. Agriculture, aquaculture, and livelihood development caused a higher level of antimicrobial resistance in surface water systems, consequently, causing health problems to water users (Ho and Goethals, 2019). Fishing, being one of the most important ecosystem services provided by inland aquatic ecosystems, contributes significantly in meeting the basic human need for food. With the increasing world population, fish consumption meets the demand for food among lakeshore communities while also serving as a substitute for beef, pork and another animal protein (Béné et al. 2015). Lake Lanao is the largest lake in Mindanao with a total area of 347 sq km and is considered as one of the 17 ancient lakes on earth. Known as a pre-historic and socioculturally significant lake, Lake Lanao shelters a great biodiversity of aquatic life forms. Through the years however, the lake has not been spared from various anthropogenic activities associated with the growing demand of the lake’s resources—the water for domestic and agricultural use and hydro-power generation, contact recreation, boating, laundry and bathing, ritual use, water sports, fishes for domestic consumption and livelihood—among other numerous related uses. (Angagao et al., 2017). Heavy metals are metallic chemical elements that occur as natural constituents of the earth’s crust. They are toxic even at low concentrations and are considered as persistent environmental pollutants since they cannot be degraded or destroyed. As trace elements, some heavy metals are essential to maintain the metabolism of the human body. However, these can lead to poisoning at higher concentrations. Their toxicity depends on several factors including the dose, route of exposure, chemical species, as well as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals (Tchounwou et al., 2012). The bio-toxic effects associated with heavy metals poisoning (cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury, zinc, copper and aluminum) have the following general signs: gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, diarrhea, stomatitis, tremor, hemoglobinuria (condition causing a rust–red color to stool), ataxia, paralysis, vomiting and convulsion, depression, and pneumonia when volatile vapors and fumes are inhaled (Duruibe et al., 2007; McCluggage, 1991). The nature of effects could be toxic (acute, chronic or sub-chronic), neurotoxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic. The dangers associated with human consumption of potentially contaminated fishes could be averted with the application of scientific inquiries that are appropriate and timely. This study sought to assess potential risks to public health, the results of which will also serve to inform and forewarn the Meranao lakeshore communities and their respective local governments about the possible contamination of fishery resources in Lake Lanao. The study was limited on the determination of heavy metal concentrations in three commonly consumed fishes sourced in Lake Lanao. The findings were compared against the recommended standard and maximum levels allowed in fishes and other foods. Furthermore, health risks were evaluated only in consideration of human consumption of fishes which are potentially contaminated with As, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb. Assessment of heavy metals 3 The Israeli Journal of Aquaculture – Bamidgeh • IJA.73.2021.1426167 Materials and Methods Study site The study was conducted in two sampling sites—first of which is the lakeshore of Marawi City an urban community and known as the center of trade, commerce, and industry in the province of Lanao del Sur (Figure 1). The first sampling site/station is located proximate to the most affected area during the Marawi armed conflict that occurred in 1997 instigated by ISIS-inspired rebels. This point is also located nearest to the source or headwaters of the Agus river. The second sampling site/station is located in the lakeshore of the Municipality of Tugaya, which is about 26.3 km from Marawi City. Tugaya is known for manufacturing traditional Maranao arts and crafts, such as back-strap loom weaving, tapestry weaving, and other kinds of handmade textile manufacture; foundry casting of various forms of brass or bronze vessels, instruments, and decorative items; wood-carving and mother-of-pearl inlay work; metalwork and silverand gold-smiting. Collection of samples Commonly consumed fish species (10-15 individuals of each species) namely, Kadurog (Glossobius giuris; average weight 0.13 ± 0.07 kg and average length 192.0 ± 44.2 cm), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus; 0.30 ± 0.17 kg and 195.6 ± 47.1 cm) and Katolong (Giuris margaritacea; 0.034 ± 0.011 kg and 112.4 ± 12.6 cm) were collected from three sub-stations located in each of the two sampling stations. Fish samples were transported to the laboratory in boxes filled with ice. The mean length and weight of the fish were recorded. All fish samples were kept at low temperature until analysis (Öztürk et al., 2009). The fish samples were thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove any adhering contaminants, and they were put on a dissection tray and thawed at room temperature. They were dissected using a knife and forceps, and the intestine, guts and bones were removed. Muscle tissues of fish (dorsal and ventral muscle) were used in this study since it is the most edible part of the fish (Listrat et al., 2016). All the samples were immediately transported to a competent and duly-accredited laboratory for the processing of the samples and determination of heavy metals. Sample preparation Muscle portion was put in a clean Petri dish and dried in an oven at 120 ± 2oC for 48 hours through which a constant weight was obtained. Before acid digestion, the dried muscle was pulverized to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and stored in a freezer (-4oC) prior to analysis. One gram of each sample (powder) was mixed with 20 ml distilled water and diluted using HNO3 (55%) and HClO4 (70%) mixed concentration in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask on a heating digester (200 to 250°C) until a clear solution was obtained and the volume was reduced to approximately 15 ml. This solution was then filtered using Whatman no. 1 filter paper into the volumetric flask and diluted to 50 ml. The prepared samples were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Inc.). Data analysis and comparison Descriptive statistics such as average and standard deviation values were calculated. Finally, the mean concentration of heavy metals found in the different fish samples were compared to the recommended accepted value provided by FAO/WHO to check if the present value of heavy metals are within the standard and tolerable limits or not. Health risk assessment The health risks associated with ingesting A","All suggests that adaptation is not an optional essential reckoning on par with business risks. Existing energy infrastructure, new and future planning need to consider conditions and impacts on design, construction, operation, and maintenance. Integrated risk-based planning processes will be critical to the impacts and harmonize actions within and across sectors. Also, awareness, knowledge, and capacity impede mainstreaming of climate adaptation into the energy sector. However, the formal knowledge base is still nascent?information needs are complex and to a certain extent regionally and sector specific. This report provides an up-to-date compendium of what is known about weather variability and projected climate trends and their impacts on energy service provision and demand. It discusses emerging practices and tools for managing these impacts and integrating climate considerations into planning processes and operational practices in an environment of uncertainty. It focuses on energy sector adaptation, rather than mitigation which is not discussed in this report. This report draws largely on available scientific and peer-reviewed literature in the public domain and takes the perspective of the developing world to the extent possible.\" environmental programs, domestic (U.S.) and global climate policy design, fishery management, water quality, endangered species, forest fires, oil security, solar power, road and airport, fuel taxes and fuel economy standards, alternative fuel vehicles, health and longevity, smoking, malaria, tuberculosis, and the environment and development. The objective is to disseminate the findings of sound, objective research on the costs, benefits, and appropriate reform of public policies. The book provides a useful supplement for undergraduate- and graduate-level course reading, a reference guide for professionals, and a way for the general reader to quickly develop an informed perspective on the most important policy problems of the day.Issues of the Day is available to download as a PDF from the Resources for the Future website: www.rff.org/weeklycommentary Environmentally-Benign Energy Solutions Climate change is now recognised as one of the greatest challenges facing the international community and when coupled with energy production and use - the most significant contributor to climate change - and the related security problems the double threat to international security and human development is of the highest order. This wide-ranging book brings together leading thinkers from academia, government and civil society to examine and address the global insecurity and development challenges arising from the twin thrust of climate change and the energy supply crunch.Part one considers energy. It analyses the challenges of meeting future energy demands and the ongoing and future security-related conflicts over energy. Coverage includes security and development concerns related to the oil and gas, nuclear, bio-fuels and hydropower sectors, ensuring energy access for all and addressing sustainable consumption and production in both developed and rapidly industrializing countries such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa. Part two analyses how climate change contributes to global insecurity and presents a consolidated overview of the potential threats and challenges it poses to international peace and development. Coverage includes future water scenarios including a focus on scarcity in the Middle East, food security, biodiversity loss, land degradation, the changing economics of climate change, adaptation and the special case of small island states.The final part lays out the potential avenues and mechanisms available to the international community to address and avert climate and energy instability via the multilateral framework under the United Nations. It also addresses mechanisms for resource and knowledge transfer from industrialized to developing countries to ensure a low-carbon energy transition by focusing on the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and ways to tackle income and employment insecurity created by the transition away from traditional energy of of change maintain preserve natural forcing tradeoffs among facets the of change in the synergies and trade-offs as as between and is that jointly by and international as as and practitioners. This addresses concerning mitigation measures in major sectors with original analyses of aspects including energy subsidies, sectoral energy efficiencies in manufacturing sectors, forest concessions, energy-saving labeling schemes, policy mixes for the urban transportation sector, and the introduction of waste-to-energy technologies. The book provides first-hand knowledge and data on energy and the institutional realities in Indonesia, which are not widely and readily available to an international audience. It offers a valuable reference guide for professionals working for governments and NGOs and donor agencies in the fields of climate change and development in developing countries. This work is also a valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate students of economics and environmental and development studies, in particular those who are interested in the synergies and conflicts between climate change and development. in particular locations. Over time, climatic disruptions to domestic energy supply could entail huge economic losses and potentially require sizable domestic military mobilizations. The United States is ill prepared for this national security challenge, and public debate about emergency preparedness is virtually nonexistent. To explore the challenges of climate risk to the U.S. energy system and national security, the Council on Foreign Relations organized a two-day workshop in New York, on March 18 and 19, 2019. The gathering of fifty participants included current and former state and federal government officials and regulators, entrepreneurs, scientists, investors, financial- and corporate-sector leaders, credit agencies, insurers, nongovernmental organizations, and energy policy experts. During their deliberations, workshop participants explored how climate-related risks to U.S. energy infrastructure, financial markets, and national security could be measured, managed, and mitigated. Impact of Climate Risk on the Energy System summarizes the insights from this workshop and includes contributions from seven expert authors delving into related topics. competition urban adaptation negotiations at international level financial rules invites reader consider the multidisciplinary aspects of these urgent energy/environmental issues. The effort has included funding science and technology, creating tax preferences, and assisting other countries in their attempts to curtail greenhouse-gas emissions. Successive Administrations have produced annual tabulations of the costs of the federal government¿s climate change programs. This study examines the government¿s commitment of resources to those purposes. It presents information on current spending and analyzes recent patterns and trends in spending. Charts and Adapting the Energy Sector to Climate Change Energy has long played a central role in the development and functioning of the world's economy. An essential input to agricultural production, transportation, industry, commerce and the home, reliance on energy will continue to grow as world population increases and standards of living improve. The trend towards increased mobility, urbanization and an integrated global economy will further accelerate our energy use and dependence. History has also shown us that increased energy use and mechanization brings with it its own burdens with respect to the environment, health, safety, lifestyle and community. Recent analysis of international energy trends shows that under \"conventional development strategies,\" global energy consumption is projected to be half again as large in 2015 as it was in the early 1990s, and may double again between 2015 and 2030. Most of the growth in energy use and its associated environmental impacts will occur in developing countries. While future changes in population, technology, and economic growth are unknown, what is clear is that a balance between energy, economics, and the environment will be needed for sustainable development to occur. A growing dependence on energy carries significant costs of its own. The extraction, refinement, transportation and storage of fuels carries an immense environmental burden, as does its ultimate consumption, and disposal of waste products. These burdens have local, regional and global manifestations, ranging from impacts on soil, groundwater and land-use, to those on atmosphere and ocean. Foremost among many communities are the local and regional environmental impacts. While these are not new issues, the need to manage our energy use and reduce its negative impacts has grown more immediate as regional economies grow and prosper. Presently, the most important global issue is the role of energy in climate change. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and biomass (wood, crop residues, dung) produces carbon dioxide (C0 2) gas as well as energy. Carbon dioxide is a \"greenhouse gas,\" which traps infrared radiation (heat) from escaping the atmosphere, affecting the earth's thermal balance. International concern about the impacts of \"global Governments’ Responses to Climate Change: Selected Examples From Asia Pacific Energy and Climate Change: An Introduction to Geological Controls, Interventions and Mitigations examines the Earth system science context of the formation and use of fossil fuel resources, and the implications for climate change. It also examines the historical and economic trends of fossil fuel usage and the ways in which these have begun to affect the natural system (i.e., the start of the Anthropocene). Finally, the book examines the effects we might expect in the future looking at eviden","Livability in cities is linked to the optimization of the conditions of urban life related to the environment in which organisms develop, and green spaces guarantee much of the biodiversity in cities. Environmental Plan of Buenos Aires (Argentina) establishes the protection, regulation and control of levels of environmental and landscape quality of public space. Urban soils may be classified as Technosols, and should be handled carefully because it may contain toxic substances. The aim of this work is to study the quality of soils considering the analysis of fertility conditions, and the content of heavy metals in urban green spaces in Buenos Aires and surroundings, since the presence of these contaminants involves risk to the health of the community. Random sampling in 48 squares of the city of Buenos Aires was performed, with a composite sample for each green space. To evaluate fertility, actual pH, electrical conductivity in the saturation extract, Bray extractable phosphorus, total organic carbon and total nitrogen were determined. The total content of the metals cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively), was evaluated in extraction with aqua regia and ICP determination. The average and maximum values resulted acceptable for Argentina legislation. Metals that showed the highest values in the studied soils were Zn and Pb. Principal component analysis showed the association between the squares and the contents of heavy metals, which can serve as a guide for monitoring samples at successive times to ensure that there is no risk for the population.","Ranavirus has caused mass mortality events in wildlife populations of reptiles and amphibians worldwide, and is proposed as a significant threat to biodiversity. It is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reportable disease known to infect fish, amphibians, and reptiles with the potential for interclass transmission via skin-skin contact, ingestion of diseased tissue, or through contact with contaminated water. Local epizootics have led to outbreak mortality rates as high as 90-100%; hence, Ranavirus can be catastrophic if introduced to a local community of ectotherms. In particular, free-ranging Eastern box turtle populations (Terrapene carolina carolina) have demonstrated increased susceptibility to Ranavirus with mass mortality events. Utilizing data from a long-term surveillance study of a closed population of T. carolina carolina in Tennessee, population viability analysis (PVA) will be completed. PVAs bring together ecology and statistics to provide information on population health, stability, and extinction risk under various conditions. The Tennessee focus population has undergone thorough mark-recapture collection and monitoring for the past eight years, resulting in population estimates of 1655 individuals. Outbreak scenarios will be modeled in the presence of a Ranavirus outbreak by meta-modeling utilizing both the software Vortex for individual-based demographic modeling and the software Outbreak for epidemiological modeling. Model estimates will be used to influence management decisions that aim to minimize the impact of this disease on biodiversity. of were presented to the University of Illinois Wildlife Medical Clinic were anesthetized for 15 minutes on 3 consecutive days. Blood was collected at times 0 and 15 minutes. Blood was collected within 3 minutes of handling to prevent any confounding factors caused by stress-induced catecholamine release. A final sample was collected 24 hours after the last anesthetic episode to detect effects on the leukogram that can be delayed 24 hours or longer. Preliminary results demonstrated an overall leukopenia characterized by heterophilia and lymphopenia. This result is similar to the hematological changes that are often attributed to a stress response in birds. It is undetermined how the leukopenia affects immune function in these patients. In all cases to date, the white blood cell count did not return to pre-anesthetic levels within 24 hours. Our results suggest that owls requiring serial administration of isoflurane anesthesia may be at increased risk for immune compromise and opportunistic infections. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a transcription factor regulating cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Increased FOXM1 is observed in human lymphoma/leukemia. Thiostrepton, an antibiotic used in commercial veterinary topicals, is a putative FOXM1 inhibitor. We hypothesize that canine lymphoma cells express FOXM1 and that thiostrepton has anti-cancer activity via FOXM1 inhibition. Four different canine lymphoma cell lines (17-71, GL-1, CL-1, and OSW) were treated with thiostrepton (0- 100μM). Expre ssion of FOXM1 and FOXM1 pathway proteins cyclin B, survivin, and Cdc25 were assessed by Western blotting. Cell viability was monitored using the tetrazolium compound MTS and by Trypan Blue exclusion. Preliminary results demonstrated that FOXM1 via FOXM1 inhibition. These results warrant further evaluation of the potential to treat cutaneous lymphoma with topical drugs containing thiostrepton. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder characterized by increased levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Though ADHD is highly heritable, the specific risk factors and genes involved largely remain undefined, in part due to lack of animal models. One emerging neurobiological correlate of ADHD is decreased cerebellar volume. From an initial population of eight diverse mouse strains, a High-Active line was selectively bred for high locomotor activity. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the High-Active line as a potential model for ADHD. Previous studies indicated that low doses of amphetamine (the active ingredient in Adderall, a common ADHD medication) decrease the activity of High-Active mice while paradoxically increasing the activity of randomly bred Control mice, encouraging further examination of the High-Active line as an ADHD model. We evaluated attention with the Y-maze paradigm, in which intact attentional capabilities prompt spontaneous alternation behavior. High-Active mice tend to exhibit lower percentages of spontaneous alternations during the first 20 arm entries than Control mice. We indirectly assessed cerebellar function (coordination) via performance on the accelerating rotarod. High-Active mice performed significantly worse than Controls, with lower average and maximum latency to fall. We examined impulsivity by quantifying nose-pokes during the Go/No-go task. We administered amphetamine or saline to High-Active and Control mice to determine whether amphetamines ameliorate the impulsivity inherent in High-Active mice, as they do for many humans with ADHD. We expect that High-Active mice will display more inappropriate nose pokes than controls, but that this trend will be less significant in High-Active mice treated with amphetamine. Use of this animal model will advance our understanding of the risk factors and genes involved in ADHD. In urban environments, stormwater management infrastructure provides an abundance of aquatic habitats that are utilized by Culex restuans and Culex pipiens, the primary vectors of West Nile Virus in Illinois. Habitats enriched with decomposing plant detritus can greatly affect the potential to produce these mosquitoes. The overall objective of this study was to examine how two common plant substrates, turfgrass and cattail, influence the potential of aquatic habitats to be colonized by, and to support the juvenile development of, vector mosquitoes. The study tested two hypotheses: 1) oviposition site selection is influenced by the type and amount of plant substrate enrichment in aquatic habitats, and 2) oviposition site selection by Cx. restuans is positively associated with the capacity of these habitats to support juvenile development. We first performed a field assay to assess oviposition response. At five study sites in Urbana, IL, oviposition of Cx. restuans and Cx. pipiens in ovitraps representing seven (three turfgrass, four cattail) discrete densities were randomly assigned to sheltered locations at least 10 m apart along the margins of woody vegetation. We measured Cx. restuans egg quantity of each ovitrap each day for three weeks. In a parallel laboratory experiment, we evaluated how the potential of these type of decaying plant infusions (turfgrass vs. cattail) and concentration of plant substrate present in the aquatic environment influences juvenile development of Cx. restuans and their effects on adult Cx. pipiens mosquito fitness. Preliminary data from these experiments support the hypotheses. Preventing juvenile mosquito development is considered one of the most effective strategies for reducing adult mosquito abundance and public health risk due to mosquito-borne disease. Municipalities may use results from our experiment in their urban mosquito control programs. Student Canine multicentric lymphoma is one of the most common types of canine cancer. Current methods to predict survival time, guide treatment choices, and determine remission status are based on clinical staging tests that are limited in predicting outcome. Thus, there is a need for alternative methods to differentiate patient status in a clinical setting. Molecular markers including serum levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), IP-10, LR-11 (SorLA) and IL-2R are biomarkers in human lymphoma/leukemia. We hypothesize that these proteins will also serve as biomarkers for canine lymphoma. Our experimental plan involves using Western blots to evaluate basal protein expression in four canine lymphoma cell lines: CL-1, GL-1, 17-71 and OSW. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) will be used to compare abundance of the four putative biomarkers in serum samples from dogs diagnosed with varying stages of lymphoma, compared to normal dogs. This work may identify a differential, measurable biomarker in canine serum that will aid disease identification and prognosis. and There different surgical between these compounds when tested using a breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate a powerful synergistic effect between DNQ and glu4j across multiple types of cancer. In vivo efficacy studies will be conducted to determine the synergistic effects of DNQ and glu4j in vivo, using murine models xenografted with A549. Tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF) are involved in neuronal growth, differentiation, and maintenance. Additionally, TrkA and NGF are expressed in other cell types (e.g. developing osteoblasts). Autocrine and paracrine signaling of the TrkA/NGF axis has an antiapoptotic effect in these bone forming cells, leading to tumorigenesis. AZ-23, a highly selective inhibitor of TrkA, is novel in its oral bioavailability. This study sought to determine if AZ-23 hinders proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways in canine osteosarcoma (OSA) cells. All methodologies were performed in vitro. The presence of TrkA in canine OSA cell lines was verified through western blotting. The effect of AZ-23 on cell proliferation was investigated using commercially available assays. The effect of AZ-23 on TrkA phosphorylation was evaluated through western blotting. Across five cell lines, one human OSA and four canine OSA, all expressed TrkA as well as the other two members of its receptor family, TrkB and TrkC. AZ-23 did not have a significant inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in any of these lines. To determine the effect of AZ-23 on ","The LIFE 02ENV/RO/000461 project had as main purpose the identification and use of bioindicators for air quality monitoring in the urban area, represented by three parks, situated in down town Bucharest, Romania, polluted by intense car traffic. Thysanoptera insects presented an increase of the biodiversity from the limits of the parks to their central parts, which is less exposed to the air pollution. Frankliniella intonsa proved to be very resistant to pollution according to the very high values of the numerical density even at the parks’ limits. Only these species presented antennal anomalies. The analysis of heavy metals in Frankliniella intonsa confirmed that this species is a very important bioindicator of urban pollution in the herbaceous layer of the parks.","Capacity of self-purification processes of urban river areas near \nBasel (CH). Improvement of rehabilitated and natural-like wetlands \nin the ancient river basins of the river Wiese, Birs and Rhine. \nIntroduction and objectives: \nUrban areas are characterized by an enormous human use density. Passing rivers and \ntheir landscapes were subjected and adapted to the human activities. Straightened and \nobstructed running waters have today become self-evident nationwide. Since the end of \nthe 20th century an increased number of projects have been trying to convert these into \nnatural forms with permitted controlled dynamics (e.g. the rehabilitation of the river \nWiese or BirsVital in the area of Basel). Following a new social consent, priority is \ngiven to recreation use and sustainability. Such rehabilitation projects in urban areas \noften encounter different conflicting aims, e.g. between nature conservation and recreation \nuse, or between striving after improved horizontal and vertical permeability (connectivity) \nand the requirements of groundwater protection. The precepts of a sustainable \nuse advise using the natural self-purification potential within a modern river landscape \nmanagement by preferring free running waters. In many cases, this won’t be possible in \nurban areas due to the requirement of space as well as the doubts raised by ground-water \nprotection or involved groups of users. Unfortunately there exist too few studies on rehabilitations \nin urban areas aiming at a chemical-physical and social optimization. \nThe two MGU projects F2.00 and F1.03 in the period 2000-2002 in the Langen Erlen \nand 2003-2005 in the Brueglinger Ebene and the Petite Camargue Alsacienne try to \nremedy these deficiencies by examining under which premises and boundary conditions \na revival of the natural wetlands and river landscapes would be possible and how the \nvarious requirements for use could be considered. This work focused on the purification \npotential of flooded, natural wetlands and shallow lakes and shows the efficiency of such \nsystems. The results are discussed against the backdrop of the adoption of such landscape \nfeatures for the improvement of rehabilitated river landscapes. \n \nMethods: \nDifferent measuring techniques (according to standardized methods) in different temporal \nresolutions are used to quantify the purification performance along the running distance \nof natural horizontal filters and for the characterisation of the water quality in the \ninvestigated wetlands. Therefore, in the areas of investigation, monthly samples were \ngenerally taken. The determination of the water quality took place on the one hand directly \nin the field (oxygen saturation, oxygen contents, water temperature, pH value, specific electrical conductivity and turbidity) and on the other hand dissolved organic \ncarbon (DOC) and UV-Absorption at 254 nm (UVA254) as well as cations (K+, Ca2+, \nMg2+) and anions (NH4 \n+, NO3 \n-, PO4 \n3-, SO4 \n2-, Cl-) were measured in the water laboratory \nof the Geographical Institute. The colony-forming units of E.coli and total coliform \ngerms were determined by means of diaphragm filtration. In the \"Hintere Stellimatten\" \nthe sampling turned out somewhat different but always with the intention to document \nthe changes within the running water. \nTo investigate the change of the water quality with increasing soil depth in the groundwater \nrecharge area \"Hintere Stellimatten\", water samples were taken by means of suction \ncandles out of different soil depths. Later – in the constructed wetland of the \nBrueglinger Ebene – six laterally slit tubing probes divided into three levels were inserted \ninto the substrate down to the tarred bedrock. They served to collect water samples \nto capture the current chemical-physical conditions and the vertical exchange and \nconversion processes along the main running distance. The same analytics (with exception \nof the microbiology and DOC-analysis) as described above are taken with these \nsamples. \nIn order to identify the influence of the surface water on the groundwater quality, water \nsamples were taken (and analyzed in the water laboratory of the Industrial Works of \nBasel, IWB) monthly or fortnightly in the groundwater well # 8 (distance 400 m) and # 9 \n(distance 100 m) near the recharge area \"Hintere Stellimatten\". Almost the same parameters \nas above were chosen. \n \nResults: \nDuring the project F2.00 in the \"Hintere Stellimatten\" in the Langen Erlen area, a procedure \nto charge the natural-like ground water recharge and protection area (belonging to \nthe IWB) with water from the river Wiese (without using energy) was tested. The purification \nperformance concerning nitrate and ammonium along the running distance of the \nnatural horizontal filter is being proofed. The reduction rates underlie fluctuations and \nfor ortho-phosphates it is even more difficult to see clear tendencies. The number of aerobe \nmesophilic germs augmented in the recharge area, and E.coli germs consequently \ndecreased by 25-30 %. Turbidity decreased strikingly (especially after the discharge of a \nhigh water wave with many suspended matter). Nearly one million m3 water of the river \nWiese was discharged in the area, which lead to a surface water/groundwater ratio up to \n70 %. In spite of this no problematic changes of the ground water quality in the near \ngroundwater well # 8 and # 9 occurred during the whole period of discharging. The discharge \nof a high water wave with many suspended matter did not change this either. \nThe artificial water system of the Brueglinger Ebene is divided into an ancient constructed \nwetland (PG) followed by a shallow lake (Quellsee, QS). The good purification \nperformance of the whole system is achieved especially thanks to the lake, while the \ncontribution of the PG is relatively low: \n \nThe first (but low) reduction of the nitrogen compounds occurs in the PG, the effects on \northo-phosphates are faint. However, the turbidity is clearly reduced in the PG: even in \n“clear” water, turbidity falls by almost 50 %, in cloudy water up to 70-80 %. More intensive \nprocesses go off in the Quellsee. As a rule, neither nitrate nor ammonium is in it \nduring the summer. Ortho-phosphate is reduced all year round (on average 75.4 % from \n0.10 to 0.03 mg/L with regard to the water from the river Birs). The mean reduction of \nnitrate at the end of the passage through the lake is 77.6 % (15.8 to 3.6 mg/L). The mean \nremoval rate of E.coli germs in the PG is 15.7 % (from 1855 to 1564 CFU/100mL), in \nthe Quellsee, however, 92.7 % (to 135 CFU/100mL) with regard to the discharged water \nfrom the river Birs. \nThe Petite Camargue Alsacienne area belongs to the ancient river floodplain of the river \nRhine and still shows structures of natural water. It was included as a supplement investigation \narea in 2005. To preserve this amphibious landscape dynamics are simulated \nwith specific interventions and a hydrological concept. In these water and flooding areas \nmetabolic cycling occurs as in natural wetlands. The following shows the (mean) \nchanges of the most important parameters: in the shallow lake Etang U the concentration \nof nitrate is reduced from 6.7 mg/L to 4.9 mg/L (-29.5 %), ortho-phosphate from \n0.06 mg/L to 0.03 mg/L (-43.9 %) and the loading of E.coli-bacteria sinks by 91.9 % \n(from 675 to 55 CFU/100mL). Turbidity decreases by 72.6 % from 8.2 to 2.3 FNU. In \nthe larger wetland Grand Marais, the purification performance is even greater: with regard \nto the discharged water from the river Rhine, the concentration of nitrate is reduced \nfrom 7.0 mg/L to 3.2 mg/L (-54.8 %) and ortho-phosphate from 0.06 mg/L to 0.01 mg/L \n(-78.6 %). The relatively long running distance leads to a decreased loading of E.colibacteria \nof 87.7 % (from 475 to 58 CFU/100mL). Turbidity decreases by 31.0 % from \n8.2 to 5.7 FNU. The smaller wetland Mare des Tritons shows an almost comparable \npotential of self-purification: with regard to the discharged water from the river Rhine, \nthe concentration of nitrate is reduced from 6.7 mg/L to 3.6 mg/L (-46.7 %) and orthophosphate \nfrom 0.06 mg/L to 0.03 mg/L (-53.0 %). The most efficient reduction of \nE.coli-bacteria occurs here, namely by 94.6 % (from 675 to 36 CFU/100mL), whereas \nsuspended matter is reduced by 83.7 % (turbidity decreases from 8.2 to 1.3 FNU). \n \nConclusions: \nAs the results of the investigations show, a clear improvement of water quality can be \nachieved even in urban river areas by an optimization of self-purification processes. Especially \nthe loadings of bacteria, nutrients and solid matter can be reduced with a few \nmeasures. This offers a cheap and natural option for artificial groundwater recharging. \nBeside this clear improvement of water quality, such wetlands are important for biodiversity \n(e.g. variety of niches and ecotopes) and groundwater-protection. At the same \ntime, these areas serve as a (substitute) habitat for wetlands species and as high-quality \nrecreation area for urban residents. Rehabilitations of urban river landscapes are to be \nendorsed, especially if they facilitate a great connectivity between water and environment with many elements of natural wetlands (e.g. shallow lakes and flooding areas). \nThere are many interesting rehabilitation possibilities within the river basins of the river \nWiese, Birs and Rhine leading to natural, attractive river landscapes.","Trees Outside Forests (TOF) were recognized in the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization’s 2000 Global Forest Resource Assessment as an essential component of sustainable development. Today, however, TOF remain an undervalued resource, with no comprehensive review of the wide spectrum of ecosystem services that are provided by TOF nor of the diversity of tree species that comprises TOF globally. Thus, a global analysis of TOF is vital to quantify their contribution to sustainable development and international climate initiatives. We reviewed the scientific literature to (1) classify and compile a repository of information on TOF resources, including the types of ecosystem services provided by TOF, geographic distribution, land-use type, and spatial pattern; and (2) document the diversity of tree species that comprises TOF globally. After screening the literature, 203 species of TOF were investigated across 20 countries in the 28 articles that we analyzed; another 15 articles across 57 countries did not include taxonomic information. Our results showed that the global distribution of TOF studies was biased toward Europe, revealing data deficiencies across the Global South, despite its contribution to biodiversity and ecosystem services. We also observed a bias in ecosystem service type toward regulating and supporting services, with studies lacking in cultural and provisioning services provided by TOF. Furthermore, studies conducted in urban areas were also lacking. To realize the full potential of TOF for sustainable development and climate initiatives, we conclude that a more holistic understanding of their ecosystem services must be established under national and intergovernmental reporting mechanisms.","The Danshuei River has a third largest catchment area and third longest in Taiwan. It flows through the capital, Taipei, and more than six million people live within its catchment area. Its estuary is characterized by a highly variable chemical and physical environment that is affected by the interaction of inland freshwater runoff with wastewater, and toward the coast is also influenced by the China Coastal Current and the Kuroshio Current. By collecting zooplankton bimonthly in 2014 from the surface layer (0–2 m depth) at five sites in the estuary, we were able to demonstrate that the composition of the zooplankton, and particularly its copepod fraction, varied significantly among sampling stations and months, thereby revealing seasonal succession. Fourteen higher taxa or other categories of zooplankter were identified, with the following being most common taxa: Decapoda, Copepoda (including Calanoida, Cyclopoida, and Harpacticoida), and “other larvae.” The Copepoda comprised 44 taxa (including eight only identified to genus) belonging to 3 orders, 17 families, and 29 genera, the five most abundant of which were Bestiolina n. sp. (undescribed), Corycaeus spp., Parvocalanus crassirostris, Acartia sp., and Paracalanus parvus. The highest and lowest copepod abundances were recorded in July (2557.88 inds. m–3) and January (1.3 inds. m–3), respectively. Observed changes in abundance of many kinds of copepod appeared to be significantly related to changes in physico-chemical parameters (e.g., salinity, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration). Cluster analysis confirmed the existence of distinct copepod communities, each characterized by a preference for a different set of environmental conditions. Our comprehensive literature review of the copepod biodiversity of Taiwan’s major rivers for comparison with similar data compiled for other estuaries in the world, the first time such a review has been compiled, shows that 32 copepod taxa have been recorded from the brackish and freshwater parts of the Danshuei River. They represent 58.2% of the total number of brackish- and freshwater copepod species in Taiwan, and five of them have so far only been recorded in the Danshuei River: the calanoids Acartiella sinensis and Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, the cyclopoids Oithona fragilis and Oithona simplex, and the harpacticoid Tachidius (Tachidius) discipes.","Author(s): MacLean, Sarah | Advisor(s): Beissinger, Steven R | Abstract: Anthropogenic climate and land-use change are widely considered to be the two greatest threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Although species may respond to changing environments in a variety of ways, the majority of species are expected to shift their distributions to track ecologically favorable habitats. The extent of these shifts may be heterogenous across species or even within a species occupying different regions, but our knowledge of what drives this heterogeneity is still sorely lacking. In particular, the effects of climate and land-use change on shifting species distributions have largely been studied independently. In more realistic scenarios, most species will experience both drivers simultaneously, creating the potential for heterogeneous changes in species composition across regions with different histories of climate and land-use change, as well as species with different sensitivities to that change.To investigate the combined effects of climate and land-use change on species occupancy and community composition, I surveyed avian diversity at 71 sites in the California Central Valley and Los Angeles. These sites were originally surveyed in the early 1900s by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, providing a unique opportunity to directly compare bird occupancy and its relation to site-specific climate and land-use covariates across a century of change. Historic surveys paired with modern resurveys documented changing distributions by 148 bird species across two regions with similar initial species and habitat composition but differing patterns of climate and land-use change.Our knowledge of species’ ecological and life history traits as predictors of sensitivity to land-use change is well developed, but the same cannot be said for traits as predictors of climate-induced range shifts. There is strong theoretical support that range shifts under climate change may be mediated by traits that facilitate dispersal and population establishment, but empirical evidence for this relationship has been mixed. In my first chapter, I conducted a meta-analysis of studies that analyzed climate-induced range shifts as a function of species’ traits, with the goal of identifying which traits have provided the strongest results. I show that the majority of traits failed to predict range shifts consistently across studies, while a much smaller number of traits, particularly habitat breadth, had strong empirical support. In subsequent chapters, I use the most informative species’ traits revealed by this meta-analysis to explore differences in species-specific occupancy change across my Central Valley and Los Angeles survey sites.Both climate and land-use change are expected to favor exotic and generalist species over specialists, resulting in declining occupancy and diversity. Using occurrence data for 122 bird species from 41 resurvey sites in the California Central Valley, my second chapter examined how occupancy and diversity changed over the past 100 years in this predominantly agricultural region, as well as the relative influence of climate versus land-use covariates to occupancy within each survey period. In contrast to expectations that occupancy and diversity would decline, both remained stable: species that increased in occupancy (predominantly habitat generalists or human adapters) roughly balanced species that decreased in occupancy (predominantly open-habitat species), resulting in no significant change in average species richness or between-site diversity. Equally surprising was the far greater importance of water availability (precipitation and water cover) to occupancy within each survey period as compared to urbanization or agricultural cover.The relative importance of climate versus land-use change to changes in species occupancy is poorly known and may result in heterogeneous patterns of diversity change across regions with different climate and land-use change histories. In my third chapter, I used occurrence data for 148 bird species across the full set of 42 Central Valley sites and 29 Los Angeles sites. I directly assessed the relative importance of climate and land-use covariates to probabilities of occupancy, persistence, and colonization, as well as compared patterns of occupancy and diversity change between the two regions. Climate and land-use covariates were both important, but to different aspects of occupancy and turnover, with climate driving initial occupancy, climate and land-use both having similar influence on colonization, and urban cover emerging as the biggest driver of local persistence. In contrast to stability in occupancy and diversity in the Central Valley, both declined in Los Angeles. This diversity loss resulted from a greater amount of urban development in Los Angeles and larger species-specific occupancy decreases in particularly forest and open-habitat species.Overall, my dissertation provides a detailed picture of how bird species have responded to over a century of climate and land-use change. These changes were highly heterogeneous across species – driven by traits, namely habitat preference – and across very similar ecological regions – driven by divergent patterns in both climate change and urbanization. As we continue to create range projections and plans to conserve future diversity, it will be important to utilize knowledge generated by long-term historical datasets and to incorporate multiple drivers of heterogeneity in species’ responses to global change.","The conservation and sustainable management of ecosystems are the vital requisites in the pursuit of environment friendly development goals. This requires an understanding of the complex functioning of ecosystems, diversity of resources, ecosystem goods and services and their quintessential role in supporting people’s livelihood. Ecological units with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements are designated as Ecologically Sensitive Regions (ESRs). Identification of ESRs has been done by considering spatially, both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables. The current research maps ESR at village levels in the Kali River Basin of Central Western Ghats through aggregated weightage metric score as ESR (1-4) based on attributes (biological, Geo climatic, Social, etc.). There are 203 villages in ESR-1, 73 in ESR-2, 77 in ESR-3, and 181 villages in ESR-4. Ecologically fragile regions to be conserved on priority with no disturbances are ESR 1 and ESR 2, while ESR 4 is for development. *Address for correspondence: Dr. T.V.

Ecosystems are the distinct biological entities that sustain the biosphere and are characterised by a range of functions: nutrient cycling, bio-geochemical cycle, hydrologic cycling, etc. They are interrelated in space and time in complex dynamic patterns depending on the health of landscape (Lin et al. 2018). Ecological sustainability refers to the ecosystems ability to cope with various kinds of environmental disturbances that have the potential of adversely changing the character of the natural landscapes while maintaining the sustenance of natural resources (water, soil, etc.). The landscape is a mosaic of interconnected forest and non-forest patches, constituting a complex ecological, economic and socio-cultural systems. Forest ecosystems have been playing a crucial role in sustaining life on the earth through the sustenance of ecological goods and services, biological diversity, regulation of climate, carbon sequestration, protection of soil and water bodies, etc. They provide abundant resources and sustain the livelihood of the global population (Gibson et al. 2011; Hansen et al. 2013), They act as prime biodiversity repositories (Kindstrand et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009) and mitigate global warming (Cabral et al. 2010) by absorbing 30 percent of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (Pan et al. 2011). The goods and services provided by forested landscapes are vital to the socioeconomic development of human populations (DeFries et al. 2004) and their survival (Ramachandra et al. 2017). However, the forests are being altered due to the uncontrolled and unplanned anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, deforestation, etc. affecting the ecosystem structure and health. Forests cover about 30 percent today at globally as opposed to 50 percent of the earth’s land area 8000 years ago depleted with the expanded extents of croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas (FAO 2011). The Earth’s land surface has lost 40 percent of natural forest by 1990 J Biodiversity, 9(1-2): 25-42 (2018) DOI: 11.258359/KRE-159 © Kamla-Raj 2018 26 T. V. RAMACHANDRA, BHARATH SETTURU AND S. VINAY due to the expansion of cropland and permanent pasture (Ramachandra and Shruthi 2007). The rapid conversion of forests for agriculture, timber production, infrastructure activities and other anthropogenic uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially calamitous consequences for biodiversity to sustain (Gould et al. 2017). Despite significant services of these ecosystems, global deforestation rates have remained alarmingly high over the past decades (DeFries et al. 2010). This necessitates synthesis of causal factors which would aid in formulating location specific management plans to mitigate impacts. The structure of a landscape depends on land cover (LC), which decides the functioning of respective ecosystems. LC refers the physical cover of a landscape such as vegetation, non-vegetation (soil, water), etc., whereas land use (LU) describes management and modification of natural environment to a human with socioeconomic functions and services. Land use land cover (LULC) analysis helps in understanding bio-geophysical processes and anthropogenic pressures on the ecosystem. LULC change resulting in deforestation has been recognized as an important driver of environmental changes due to alterations in temperature-humidity response pattern affecting plant physiology and diverse ecosystem functions (Findell et al. 2017). The uncontrolled LU changes in forested landscapes induce imbalances by subdividing the contiguous native forests in to smaller fragments with isolated patches, which is known as forest fragmentation (Laurance et al. 2002; Bharath et al. 2012). Fragmentation refers to breaking up of contiguous natural forest patches into smaller tracts of forest surrounded by other land uses, causing a disruption in continuity of the natural landscape (Ramachandra et al. 2016a). Forest fragmentation with subsequent edge effects due to infrastructure developments (linear projects, etc.) has impaired ecosystem goods and services including carbon sequestration ability, hydrologic regime, biodiversity (Harper et al. 2005; Vinay et al. 2013; Bharath et al. 2014), aggravate predation (Cagnolo et al. 2006), fire susceptibility, alters microclimate and enhance carbon emissions (Houghton and Nassikas 2017). The unrestrained deforestation will alter microclimate of the region, leading to increasing in land surface temperature and proliferation of exotic species (Ramachandra et al. 2018) and disease vectors. This necessitates quantification of LULC changes to evolve sustainable natural resource management strategies. Conservation of forest ecosystem has become a critical task due to increased high intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in the form of LULC changes as compared to natural disturbance processes (Kivinen and Kumpula 2013). This has led to the development of systematic conservation planning approaches as an increasingly vital tool for protecting the nature around the world. The comprehensive knowledge about LULC has become increasingly important for planning and visualization of future growth to overcome the problems of haphazard, uncontrolled development in ecologically sensitive regions (Kennedy et al. 2009). Temporal remote sensing data, geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, free and open source software technologies are providing efficient methods for the analysis of LULC dynamics required for planning and protection (Ramachandra et al. 2014). The forests of Western Ghats are undergoing deforestation, while the forest under protected areas is also experiencing the risk of land use changes. The conservation and sustainable management of ecosystems are the vital requisites for sustenance of natural resources. The impact of unplanned developmental activities during the post-independence period is evident from the barren hilltops, conversion of perennial streams to seasonal ones, loss of livelihood, etc. This necessitates an understanding of the complex functioning of ecosystems, diversity of resources, ecosystem goods and services and their quintessential role in supporting people’s livelihood. Ecological units with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements are designated as Ecologically Sensitive Regions (ESRs). Identification of ESRs has to be done considering ecological, bio-geo climatic, social dimensions of environmental variables. Ecologically Sensitive Regions (ESR) are defined under conservation planning approach as ‘‘large units of land or water containing a geographically distinct assemblage of species, natural communities, and environmental conditions” (Olson et al. 2001). ESR has the capacity to support and maintain the balanced and integrated ecosystem in a particular region under protective measures. Systematic conservation by prioritization of sensitive regions has become an effective and ecoECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY 27 nomical method (Myers et al. 2000) and is widely used to improve ecosystem by conservation practices. With respect to Indian scenario, Union Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate change (MoEFCC) has taken an initiative to protect forests and maintenance under section 3 of Environment (Protection) Act 1986 (EPA). Central Government can prohibit or restrict the location of industries and carry out certain operations on the basis of considerations like the ecological sensitivity under section 5 of EPA 1986. The MoEFCC had set up Pronab Sen Committee in the year 2000 to identify parameters for designating ESRs in the country to counter the rapid deterioration of the environment, both nationally and internationally (MoEF 2000). The committee has defined ecological sensitivity or fragility as permanent and irreparable loss of extant life forms from the world; or significant damage to the natural processes of evolution and speciation. Based on this, Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) demarcated ecological sensitive regions and suggested prohibited and regulated activities in the respective zones of the Western Ghats (Gadgil et al. 2011) considering multi-disciplinary inputs from the stakeholders. Subsequently, a high-level working group (HLWG), designated about 37 percent (that is, 60,000 sq. km.) of Western Ghats as ESA. However, both these reports were unsuccessful in generating confidence on the g","This research aimed to determine the concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) pollutants in coastal sediment, Semarang, to create a statistical model based on the result of test that would be obtained from costal sediments samples, to make permite statements about pollution and change that occurs on the state of the environment in the urban catchment, creating database on pollution control in the region and in the future to maintain biodiversity (to give the industrial activities-pollution permits-by official bodies for the protection of the environment in the state). This research would be conducted in 2017 with the location of sampling and water quality measurement conducted at Usman Janatin Street, Semarang. The sample analysis would be conducted at the Diponegoro University Integrated Laboratory. In this research was focused on deep and width. According to some previous studies such as study done by Mancuso et al. that stated the TAL metals analysis results gave a wide scope of the concentration of metals in coastal urban area. Based on the analysis and result, the conclusion as follows: There was relationship between levels of heavy metals and external environment. The relationship was positive, it means the higher levels of heavy metals, the external environment would be more polluted. The lower levels of heavy metals, the external environment would be low polluted. The internal levels of coastal sediment could be used as an index to infer the state of the environment. This heavy metals determination tool could be used to support policy and decision-making.","Excess nitrogen (N) loads are considered one of the greatest threats to the integrity of coastal ecosystems but a variety of influencing factors make the amount and rate of N input to the coast difficult to determine. Explored in this study is the effect of short term inundation on potential N flux from four ecosystems in St. John’s County, Florida: submerged, marsh, upland and residential. Four soil cores were collected from each of the four ecosystems. After saturation, each of the cores was inundated with a 10cm head of floodwater. Floodwater samples were then collected after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 72, 120 and 168 hours and were analyzed for TKN, NH4-N and NOx-N to determine the Total Nitrogen (TN) concentration and flux through the study period. Results found no statistical difference in the TN concentration or flux in the floodwater among the four sites after a short term 24-hour inundation. However, at the end of seven days of inundation, the residential and upland TN concentrations and flux were significantly higher than the marsh and submerged ecosystems. These results show that a short term flooding event will have similar effects on N flux regardless of ecosystem, but a longer duration of inundation of a week or more could lead to a significantly greater N flux from the residential and upland ecosystems. This could possibly pose a threat as future predictions in sea level rise leave inland communities vulnerable to increased flooding events and prolonged inundation, causing excess N concentrations in the floodwater to be transported into the coastal waters. Phytoremediation of As-contaminated soils by As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata: long-term efficiency and biomass disposal Authors: Evandro B. da Silva, Jason T. Lessl, Ann C. Wilkie, Lena Q. Ma Soil and Water Sciences Department Arsenic (As) is toxic to plants, animals and humans. Therefore, it is important to reduce its exposure to humans. Phytoextraction is a low-cost technology that utilizes hyperaccumulator plants to extract metals from soils. As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata (Chinese brake fern) can accumulate up to 23,000 mg kg-1 As in the fronds. However, disposal of the As-laden biomass might represent a drawback of phytoremediation using P. vittata. Its ability in taking up As from three As-contaminated soils was assessed over 6 years using plots containing 162 kg soil, each supporting 9 plants. Arsenic extraction from P. vittata biomass was assessed by using water and 30% ethanol. P. vittata reduced soil As concentrations by 45-47%, from 129, 26.6 and 29.8 mg kg-1 to 69, 16 and 14 mg kg-1. After 3 years, As accumulation in P. vittata fronds decreased probably due to labile As being depleted. Over time, the As from the amorphous fraction exhibited the highest decrease, showing the unique ability of P. vittata to solubilize non-labile As in soil. Arsenic in P. vittata biomass was ~60% water soluble and 85% ethanol soluble. Addition of MgCl2 helped formation of magnesium arsenate precipitate [Mg3(AsO4)2], reducing solution As concentration to &lt; 2 mg L-1. P. vittata was effective in remediating As-contaminated soils and ethanol was efficient in extracting As from P. vittata biomass. TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF DENITRIFICATION IN SANDY PASTURE SOILS D. Katelyn Foster, Xiaolin Liao, Patrick W. Inglett* With the increasing rise of nitrate levels in groundwater, it is important to understand its origin, transport, and fate. Denitrification is an effective form of nitrate removal facilitated enzymatically by microorganisms, and is strongly temperature dependent, especially in sandy soils with low water holding capacity. This study focused on identifying how temperature controls denitrification enzyme activity in sandy pasture soils of high (HD) and low (LD) manure loading rate. The effect of temperature (as apparent Q10) was compared at various moisture levels ranging from 22%to 50 % water-filled pore space. We hypothesized that differences in major N processes (mineralization, nitrification, oxygen demand) between the two systems would alter the temperature sensitivity. When comparing the two soils, the rate of denitrification was always higher in the HD pasture regardless of temperature or %WFPS. For both soils, denitrification increased exponentially with temperature, with the exception of LD35% WFPS. The Q10 values for both soils were higher than 2, with the LD soil at approximately 4.6 and showing no significant trend with %WFPS. The HD soil Q10 value ranged from 39-140, with an overall decrease in the value with increase in %WFPS. Compared to other studies in sandy soils, as expected, denitrification rate was affected by temperature more than %WFPS. Increasing %WFPS also increased denitrification, except for the HD pasture, where under warmer temperatures (20, 250C) rates decreased with increasing moisture. The results are currently unexplained, but the findings of this study will help improve models of soil denitrification in N mass balances, and help direct potential mitigation strategies. Solid State and Solution Chemistry to Evaluate Phosphorus Release from Biochars Andressa Freitas1, Vimala D. Nair1, Willie G. Harris1, Cheryl Mackowiak2 (1) Department of Soil and Water Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, (2) North Florida Research and Education Center, University of Florida , Quincy FL Land-application of biochar, a product of biomass heating, has recently been promoted as a sustainable agricultural practice that improves soil health and crop yield. However, the diversity in biochar feedstocks may confer different abilities in desorption of phosphorus (P). Our objective was to evaluate P associations in different biochars as well as its desorption when mixed with distinct soils. Mineralogical assessment (XRD) and elemental association (SEM-EDS) were performed in conjunction with desorption experiments in order to assess the mechanisms by which P is held. The desorption experiment was performed by mixing 1% (w/w) biochar from feedstocks of poultry litter (PLB), biosolids, mixed hard woods (HWB) and pure maple with two contrasting soils followed by repeated 0.01 M KCl extractions. The total P concentrations were: 25 615, 67 330, 1898 and 730 mg kg-1 for PLB, biosolids, HWB and maple biochars, respectively. Magnitude and pattern of P release depended on the biochar and soil type. The mineral whitlockite in PLB was indicated by XRD and corroborated by SEM-EDS analyses; solution analysis indicated a long-term P release consistent with the sparingly soluble mineral. Association between Mg and P in biosolids biochar was evident from SEMEDS, consistent with XRD indication of struvite in the raw biosolids. No associations between P and other elements could be confirmed for HWB or maple biochars. All biochars released P rapidly initially, but levelled off after the first few extractions. Based on solid phase and solution chemistry, field application of biochar should take into consideration both the biochar and soil type to minimize environmental problems of over application of P. A Discussion of Methods of Stakeholders' Mental Models of Soil Management Relating to Food Security in India. Claire Friedrichsen1, Samira H. Daroub2, Martha C Monroe1, John R Stepp1 and Suhas Wani3, (1)University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, (2) Soil and Water Science, University of Florida, Belle Glade, FL, (3)ICRISAT, Patancheru, India In 2015, there were 795 million people who were undernourished with a majority located in developing countries. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations expects agricultural production will need to be increased by 70% to meet the global food demand in 2050 with a population of 9.1 billion. Past solutions to global food security had unintentional consequences such as the dust bowl, dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, lost of traditional farming systems and lost of biodiversity. Local knowledge held by farmers is more specific to the local ecosystem and can predict consequences of change in soil management. Understanding farmer, scientist, and extension agents beliefs is essential to increasing food security by limiting unintentional consequences and improving communication between the stakeholders. This study uses the cultural models theory from cognitive anthropology to understand the belief systems of soil management relating to food security of stakeholders in six villages facing urbanization in Telangana, India. The Integrated Farmer Participatory Watershed Management Model (IFPWM) was development by ICRISAT and was first implemented in these communities starting in 2014 as part of a five year project. Interviews, observations, soil data, and trace measures were used to collect data on the belief systems of IFPWM stakeholders. The results of this study are multiple mental models of the IFPWM stakeholders. The results can also be used to focus future soil science research to meet global food demand. Background Concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Heavy Metals in Florida Urban Soils. Peng Gao1, Jing Su2, Evandro Barbosa da Silva1, Leo Jackson da Silva Moreira1, Timothy G. Townsend2 and Lena Q. Ma1 (1) Soil and Water Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (2) Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) result from phytogenic, petrogenic and pyrogenic sources in the environment. Generally, anthropogenic factors have the most impact on PAH distribution in urban areas, whereas natural factors affect their distribution in remote areas. These organic chemicals are ubiquitous and pose a risk for human health because of their potentially carcinogenic nature and availability in the environment that humans come in contact. Among all the environmental matrix, soil is the most important sink for PAHs. This is because PAHs are hydrophobic, semivolatile, readily adsorbed by soil particles, a","research presents the synthesis and characterization of a potential \"cool\" pigment through a solid-state reaction to mitigate urban heat island effects. LiCu 1–x Ni x P 2 O 7 (x=0–1)was prepared via solid-state synthesis to study color tunability on potential pigments. The powder samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction and CIE L*a*b* colorimetry to study their phase purity and the effects of substituting 3d transition-metal Ni 2+ at the square planar sites of Cu2+. XRD and Rietveld analyses reveal that the doping of Ni 2+ has retained the Li 2 CuP 2 O 7 structure where x is 0.1 to 0.4. Samples exhibited a gradual color change from blue to green to yellow in the complete series. It will be further analyzed by obtaining near IR reflectance values and SEM images to study and determine their potential as cool pigments. Additionally, microwave-assisted synthesis will be attempted to control particle sizes and accelerate the synthesis of cool pigments. reflectance. Several syntheses will be presented using both furnace heating and microwave-assisted heating to synthesize Co2-xNixP2O7 pigments, and these materials are characterized using X-ray diffraction, FTIR data analysis, colorimetry, and electron microscopy. The heat-reflectance properties are measured using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the near-IR region. An understanding of color tunability and the effects of particle size control on heat-reflectance in this family of materials will allow a greater understanding of rational design of cool pigments. conducted to date to address the efficacy of restoring these species together. In summers 2019 and 2021, we collected eelgrass shoots and pore-water samples from three restored sites within UNB, each with eelgrass restored alone versus eelgrass restored adjacent to oysters. We measured leaf and rhizome growth rates, and organic tissue nitrogen. We analyzed these response metrics relative to distance from and density of oyster beds using co-variogram models. Results indicated positive associations between oysters and eelgrass at closer distances, and elevated tissue nitrogen in the oyster treatments across all sites. Given this potentially positive relationship, project managers should consider restoring both species in combination because each species can return unique ecosystem functions. The and transport of crude represents one of the most substantial threats to the health and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. Through both acute and chronic accidental leakage and spillage, exposure to oil leads to various negative health effects on wildlife including hypothermia, reduced mobility, and mortality from ingestion. Despite the extensive evidence of the short-term effects on the survival and health of wildlife caused by oil pollution, less is understood of the long-term effects. The continued demand for oil as a source of energy necessitates an increased understanding of the potential chronic health effects caused by oil pollution on wildlife. We conducted an observational experiment to assess the health of a freshwater turtle species, the northern map turtle, using several metrics of individual stress levels, immune function, and body condition ten years following the Kalamazoo River Oil Spill. We collected blood samples from turtles captured from four sites along the Kalamazoo River that underwent varying levels of oil exposure. We assessed immune function using assays that measure bacterial-killing and natural antibody agglutination capacity, estimated physiological stress levels using heterophil: lymphocyte and eosinophil ratios, and quantified body condition and carapace algae cover. We found no difference in any measure of health among the four sites, suggesting subsequent recovery from health detriments potentially caused by oil exposure following the 2010 spill. These results contribute to the understanding of the chronic effects of oil exposure as well as the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts to be considered during future instances of oil pollution. inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CFDC is higher. These fluids are also associated with a reduction in the expression of genes related to iron uptake systems, which could explain the need for higher concentrations of CFDC to exert antibiotic action. CFDC is used for treating urinary tract infections, where bacterial cells are exposed to urine. We analyzed the impact of human urine (HU), which contains low albumin concentrations, on the expression of iron-uptake related genes and MIC values of two carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii . Levels of resistance to CFDC were not modified by HU in strain AMA40 but were reduced in the case of strain AB5075. Tests on other carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates showed that the resistant levels were unmodified or reduced in the presence of HU. The expression of piuA, pirA, bauA , and bfnH was enhanced in both strains when HU was present in the culture medium was determined by qRT-PCR. All four tested genes are involved in recognizing ferric siderophore complexes or internalization into the cell’s cytosol. The effect of HU on genes associated with is a novel antibiotic that utilizes the iron uptake system of bacteria through a siderophore moiety to more directly impact cell wall synthesis. Analysis has shown that Acinetobacter baumannii has responded to human fluids like pleural and serum, as well as human serum albumin, by down regulating iron uptake genes, and up regulating beta lactamase genes conferring potentially higher resistance. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefiderocol were measured and showed higher values in cultures supplemented with human fluids. These results are evidence of a correlation that could explain a lowered clinical efficacy of cefidercol in treating A. baumannii bloodstream infections. high selectivity negatively charged lipids, like phosphatidylserine (PS) and mono-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIPs), we hypothesized that the interaction of HSPA1A with these lipids allows the chaperone to translocate and anchor to the PM. To test this hypothesis, we subjected human cell lines to heat shock, depleted specific lipid targets, and quantified HSPA1A’s PM localization using confocal microscopy and cell surface biotinylation. These experiments revealed that depletion of PS, PI(4)P, and PI(3)P by co-transfecting HSPA1A with known lipid-biosensors, significantly reduced HSPA1A’s surface presentation. In contrast, reducing PI(4,5)P 2 availability by overexpression of the PLCδ-PH biosensor had minimal effects on HSPA1A’s PM-localization. Next, we manipulated the cellular lipid content using ionomycin (a PLC activator), phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and GSK-A1 (general and a selective PI4 Kinase inhibitors, respectively), wortmannin (a PI3-Kinase inhibitor), and fendiline (a repurposed FDA approved drug that reduces PS) using lipid-biosensors as positive and negative controls. These experiments revealed that HSPA1A’s PM localization was unaffected by ionomycin but was greatly reduced in the presence of PAO, GSK-A1, wortmannin, and fendiline, corroborating the findings obtained by the co-transfection experiments. We further verified these results by selectively depleting PI(4,5)P 2 and PI(4)P using a well-established rapamycin-induce phosphatase system. Our findings strongly support the notion that HSPA1A’s surface presentation is Our results evidence of and Pin-tailed whydahs ( Vidua macroura ) (PTW) are birds from Africa that were introduced to southern California (SoCal). PTWs are songbirds that learn song from conspecifics, allowing them to communicate with their own species. PTWs were transported to California for the pet trade; once the population established locally, their songs may have diverged from the African source population. This project aimed to investigate the effects of the geographic isolation from the PTWs ancestors. We hypothesized that male SoCal PTWs would have a stronger response to SoCal song versus African song. We created playbacks of both the SoCal and African song. We conducted simulated territorial intrusions with five male PTWs using a speaker and song recordings; each 300-second playback trial consisted of Africa song, SoCal song, and control (silence) segments. For each male PTW, the number of chirps, flyovers, trills, and number of times the birds entered the playback radius were recorded. PTWs changed perches significantly more often during SoCal playbacks compared to Africa and control playbacks (p &lt; 0.05 ANOVA). The mean number of flyovers and vocalizations were higher during SoCal playbacks than during Africa and control playbacks, however, the responses were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05 ANOVA). Our results suggest that allopatric speciation may be occurring due to the geographical separation of the PTWs an divergence in response to locally recorded song versus song from Africa. Future research entails expanding our sample size to better understand how male PTW recognize song and to investigate responses by female PTWs.","Tabasco is located in one of the ten more important basins of North America. One third of all water resources in Mexico passes through here. Flooding events are part of the natural history of the basin; however floods have increased spatially and in magnitude. Data regarding total annual rainfalls as high as 4000 mm are registered regularly within the border of Tabasco and Chiapas. The most important wetlands of Mexico are located here on the low river basin of the Grijalva and Usumacinta rivers. Since ancient times, people in this part of Mexico are related to this flooding system in a variety of ways. A system of dams generates most of the electricity power used on Southern Mexico. Oil exploitation, cattle breeding and agriculture are the main economic activities and are responsible for an important loss of the natural ecosystems and ecosystem services. The objective of this research was to study flooding causes in this area. Geomorphology, climate, topography, hydrology and soil maps were constructed. A historical review of floods, river courses, and land use as well as an analysis of meteorological data were performed. Ecosystem vulnerability was evaluated. Results show that there has been a loss of 90% of the original biodiversity of tropical forest due mainly to farming and poor cattle management activities. Road infrastructure, unplanned urban growth and oil exploitation infrastructure has caused an important impact especially on the hydrodynamics and coastal areas. Extraordinary events with more than 200 mm in 24 hours are more common each year. The amount and intensity of floods today has increased and put at risk a great number of the population.

It is aimed to find the method or the system of methods assessing the ecosystem services which are the most suitable to assess the services provided by ecosystem in urban areas.The rational and balanced use of ecosystem services is very important for their socio-economic assessment, the protection of biodiversity in cities in order to ensure the recreational, cultural, economic, social, sanitary, hygienic and other needs of society. According to the principle of sustainable development, the economic and social development of the country has to be oriented so that the meeting today’s needs would not diminish the possibilities to satisfy the needs of future generations, to account for resource constraints, with a view to sustainable use and conservation of resources. Such data are essential to form the policy of natural resource consumption through the management of national resources. The public is more aware of the aesthetic and protective functions of natural ecosystem, but they do not have sufficient knowledge of their economic and social value. Although foreign literature provides a large number of studies in this sphere, only individual methods for assessing the ecosystem services are analyzed in Lithuania. Research in the evaluation of the ecosystem services in Lithuania has not been developed. When it is not possible to quantify the supply with demand for ecosystem services, it is more difficult to prove the real economic risks that arise. Answers to these issues are necessary not only for scientists but also for managers in deciding on the adaptation of limited natural resources for social needs and preservation for future generations. To assess the ecosystem services in urban areas, which are described as ecosystem conditions and processes contributing to human quality of life and important for day-to-day decisions at the political, economic and environmental levels, there is a need for an economic and social assessment system that helps to determine the value of ecosystem services. The value of ecosystem services in most countries of the world is underestimated and incorporated into decision-making. It is important to analyze the theoretical principles of assessing the ecosystem services to develop the economic and social model for the future assessment of the ecosystem services.Analytical methods are more essential in comparing the use of ecosystems than establishing the absolute ecosystem values. Selection methods are used for assessing ecosystem services: market, travel costs, hedonistic. Priority methods: joint analysis, contingent assessment are used as well. Cost-based avoidance methods are used when ecosystem services are valued according to costs incurred as a result of the loss of the ecosystem service or the costs of transferring or replacing the service. The new method for evaluating ecosystem services is the method of deliberative monetary valuation. The multi-criteria assessment method allows to conduct the simultaneous evaluation of several contradictory criteria, which is especially relevant for environmental decision-making. For socio-economic evaluation of ecosystem services, researchers apply a cost-benefit analysis method that is most often used to evaluate public sector investment projects. These projects are generally financially unprofitable, but aim at identifying the socioeconomic value they create. The value-for-consumption and non-use value of ecosystems in the overall economic value structure can be determined by consumer valuation, contingent or hedonistic price methods. The valuation of non-market (non-market flows or assets) is, in essence, an indication of the environmental performance of aggregates rather than a specific expression of the market price of a financial transaction. For this purpose, the subjective, hypothetical value and price determination and justification methodology, the subjective approach based on the value of indirect use or disclosed preferential methods are used to define the value and determine the value. In many cases, ecosystem services are not marketed and do not have market prices, but their economic value or market value cannot be assumed to be zero. In cases where ecosystems do not have a market price (because there is no market), but an individual agrees (is willing) to pay for the opportunity to use it or receive compensation for not using it, the economic value of the good would be related to the amount of the price paid by the consumer. The benefits of urban ecosystems are indirect, therefore, it is often difficult to assess it in monetary terms. However, it is necessary to compare the benefits and costs of this ecosystem resource. It is suggested that different ecosystem services provided in the cities are identified by using different assessment methods appropriate to different ecosystem types. Selection methods based on human behavior and choice are used in cases where interrogators may experience different effects of the provided ecosystem service. These are market price, travel costs, hedonistic, deliberative monetary valuation methods. The preferred methods of disclosure-contingent assessment, choise experiment methods are used to determine the value of non-use provided by all three types of ecosystem services. The value of non-use of ecosystem services is the value of preserving and retaining biodiversity for future generations. The set value helps to prevent loss of change. The most recent method for evaluating ecosystem services – the method of deliberative monetary valuation – is more appropriate to be regarded not as the main but as an additional assessment method. The multicriteria method allows to conduct simultaneous evaluation on the basis of several contradictory criteria, which is especially relevant for national policies in environmental issues. The cost-benefit analysis method is most often used in evaluating public sector investment projects. These projects are generally financially unprofitable, but aim at identifying the socioeconomic value they generate.In determining the value of providing ecosystem services in cities, it is important to choose the right method or system. The diversity of ecosystem services and their functions suggests that it is necessary to integrate assessment methods in such a way as to enable them to reflect the benefits of these services for the public not only at present, but also preserving the ecosystem for future generations. All methods have the advantages and the disadvantages, only by combining them we can have rational assessment of natural ecosystem services. In the evaluation of the services provided by the type of ecosystem in the city, it is suggested to use cost benefit analysis and conjoint analysis methods. The contingent assessment method should be used to assess cultural and regulatory services. An appropriate regulatory type of ecosystem services is evaluated using both multicriterion and choise experment methods, integrating the contingent method with the travel cost method when assessing cultural ecosystem services. In order to incorporate society into decision-making, additional methods of a deliberative monetary valuation and expert evaluation are needed.","Hundreds of millions of urban dwellers in low- and middle-income nations are at risk as 4-5 of the global weather-driven disasters experienced are consequent of a changing climate. Studies have shown that residents in least developed countries have ten times more chances of being affected by these climate disasters than those in wealthy countries. Further, critical views have it, that it would take over 100years for lower income countries to attain the resiliency of developed countries. Unfortunately, global South is surrounded by a myriad of socio-economic and environmental factors limiting their fight against climate crisis. It is this germane reality that provoked the cause of this review. Hence, this paper reviewed the developing world's contribution to global warming and the resulting consequences of climate change with focus on Nigeria. This purposive approach adopted an analysis of secondary data related to climate information. The findings from the paper affirmed that impacts of climate change in developing countries include loss in agriculture/forestry resources, water shortage, food insecurity, biodiversity loss, health risks among others. Finally, it identified the major factors that exacerbate climate crisis, the human actions that trigger global warming and adaptive and mitigation approaches to minimize climate change related disasters.","Ecosystem Services is an important concept to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2030. For the past 20 years, this concept has grown exponentially and the metadata of these publications can be considered as big data. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to Ecosystem Services publications from Web of Science database, which are text-mining analysis, bibliographic coupling, and citation network analysis. Text-mining analysis results were a cluster map of keywords representing the content of abstract and title from 4203 publications in the dataset. Bibliographic coupling analysis results were a cluster of documents which analyzed using natural language processing to extract the main idea of the documents. Using these two analysis insight about ecosystem services are obtained. Ecosystem services in general can be divided into 6 big clusters: economic assessment of ecosystem services as natural capital, ecosystem services assessment in term of accounting and management, biodiversity conservation in term of species richness, biodiversity conservation in term of human well-being, climate change and ecosystem services, and ecosystem services in urban area. Finally, citation network analysis was performed. 5700 publications consist of publications from the dataset and cited references from the publications were analyzed and 50 most influential articles from 1977 to 2018 with highest citation score was plotted in chronological order, providing insight on how the topic has been developing over time and important publications to be read. Bibliometric analysis proved to be very useful, especially as the preliminary step before conducting literature review. This technique can be very beneficial for early career scientists who wanted to recognize a field of science or wanted to know the research gaps that could be worked on.","Agroecology is coming into its own as an alternative paradigm to corporate-led industrial food systems. Evidence of the advantages, benefits, impacts, and multiple functions of agroecology abounds (see: HLPE 2019 for a review). For many the evidence is clear: agroecology, together with ‘food sovereignty’, offer a pathway for more just and sustainable food systems and communities. The questions that remain are about how to foster the enabling conditions, and mitigate the disabling ones, so that agroecology can flourish (Anderson et al. 2020). There has been a good deal of recent debate about agroecology transitions, transformations, massification, amplification, as well as how to “scale up” and “scale out” agroecology as a new paradigm for food and agriculture. This new thinking and research could not be more relevant in the context of deepening ecological and social crises (IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) 2019; IPCC 2018; World Inequality Lab 2018). It is in this context that we have been bringing together allied researchers, activists, food producers and policy-makers in our work at AgroecologyNow (www.agroeco logynow.com) at the UK-based Center for Agroecology, Water and Resilience (https://www.coventry.ac.uk/cawr). As a community of practice, we have been examining the contours of this growing body of work on agroecology transformations and probing its edges and horizons. This special issue is a part of this collective work to broaden the discussion on agroecological transitions. Some of the articles (Dale 2020; Meek and Anderson 2020; Siegner, Acey, and Sowerwine 2020) were amongst twenty-one papers and panels in a stream of sessions we coordinated on ‘Agroecology Transformations’ at the American Association of Geographers meeting in Washington, DC in April 2019. Meek and Anderson’s article was further developed in a retreat hosted by AgroecologyNow in which we convened a group of twenty-five researchers, activists, farmers and organizers from around the world involved in research and knowledge co-production that aims to advance movements for agroecology and food sovereignty. Other articles (Schiller et al. 2020; Tornaghi and Dehaene 2020) arose in response to a call for papers distributed through our networks. The five articles in this special issue provide new insights into agroecological transformations. The focus of Siegner, Acey, and Sowerwine (2020) and Tornaghi and Dehaene (2020) on agroecology in an urban context are welcome contributions in a field often dominated by research in rural areas. The role of the State in transitions-transformation features in two articles. Schiller et al.’s (2020) analysis shows how agroecology has been largely co-opted by regime actors in Nicaragua. Similarly, Meek and Anderson (2020) articulate how the visions and processes of scaling deployed by the Sikemese State in the organic transition are predominantly promoting homogeneity, productivism and market-oriented processes of transition. These two papers show how state-centric processes of transition can often undermine the radical potential of agroecology. Finally, Dale’s (2020) article written in the Canadian context argues for the importance of alliances across boundaries (e.g. AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS 2020, VOL. 44, NO. 5, 561–565 https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2019.1709320","Climate changes are expected to increase the conditions of aridity in many regions of the world and, therefore, water and heat stress events that affect natural vegetation and cultivated plants (Manes &amp; Blasi, 1995; Hoerling et al., 2001; iPCC, 2013; Diffenbaugh &amp; Field, 2013; Mariotti et al., 2015). the eu Biodiversity strategy to 2020 promotes also the recovery of degraded ecosystems, in order to improve their ecosystem services (es) provision. it is known that ecosystem services are closely related to the ecosystems health, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the occurrence of stress phenomena on vegetation. in this context, the application of non invasive, non destructive techniques for field studies and laboratory instrumental analyses is needed, in order to monitor the occurrence of stress conditions that could reduce the functional performance of species in the ecosystems, thus causing a reduction of their es provision. at this regard, the measurement of Chlorophyll “a” Fluorescence (ChlF) represents a relatively fast and low-cost approach, that can be easily applied in vivo both under controlled conditions and in natural environments, allowing the detection of the stress effects on intact leaves/plants before the appearance of any visible sign of injury (oukkarroum &amp; strasser, 2004; salvatori et al., 2014; Gottardini et al., 2014). For this reason, it is extensively used in plant physiology researches, both to study the mechanism of light harvesting and electron transport between and beyond the two photosystems (photosystem ii, Psii and photosystem i, Psi) and in applied studies to assess the mechanisms and effects of biotic and abiotic stresses on the photosyntetic efficiency and performances of plants (Papageorgiou and Govindjee, 2004). Furthermore, ChlF is a useful tool for experimental research in ecophysiology, agriculture, forestry and arboriculture (for reviews, see Ball et al., 1994; Maxwell and Johnson, 2000; Mohammed et al., 2003; Bussotti et al., 2010; Kalaji et al., 2014), and can be also measured in remote sensing studies carried out at different spatial and temporal scales (Manes et al., 2001). in this collection of papers of annali di Botanica – Coenology and Plant ecology, several aspects of the current researches in this topic have been highlighted, involving the application of different ChlF techniques (Prompt, Modulated, imaging and sun-induces) on forest, crop and urban green species. Guidi et al. (2016) have reviewed the theoretical bases of ChlF, the use of the most important ChlF parameters to estimate changes in plant photosynthetic activity, as well as the relation between actual Psii photochemistry and Co2 assimilation. in particular, insight on the application of modulated ChlF and ChlF imaging to study heterogeneity of leaf lamina has been provided under the following EDITORIAL TO:","Abas, A. 2020.

DOI: 10.1639/0007-2745-125.1.205","Anurans are popularly recognized for their bimodal life that generally includes an aquatic larval and terrestrial adult. They are pokilothermic organisms and the body temperature is strongly correlated with that of the environmental temperature. The most serious cause of amphibian and reptile decline in Europe is the loss of habitats (Ivelin 2011).The processes of habitat fragmentation and changes to the quality of habitat influenced the frog population across Melbourne (Kirsten 2006). Some local and regional factors influence the decline of frogs and toads in Michigan (Earl Werner et al. 2007).The Western Ghats is one of the 25 biodiversity hot spots in the world. Anurans are the integral components of many ecosystems and constitute the highest fraction of vertebrate biomass. They play an important role in acting as both predator and prey species and perform a key role in tropic dynamics (Odum 1956). Urban habitats are expanding throughout the world, and the processes of urbanization threaten the persistence of many plant and animal species. Amphibians, especially anurans, can inhabit many environments, from thick forest to small ponds. They adopt different physiological and behavioural traits. The decline in anuran population indicates ecosystem deterioration that might affect a wider spectrum of earth biological diversity. The anuran species richness is always correlated with the water body. The magnitude and direction of urban impacts on each species depends on that species life history attributes, sensitiveness to environmental disturbances, interspecies interactions and dispersal ability (Dickman 1987). The urbanization increases the density of human population and other infrastructures, which result in the displacement of flora and fauna. The diversity of fauna species exhibits varying responses to urbanization. The development rate and time to metamorphosis in Rhinella spinulosa is associated with pond duration (Marquez 2009). Concern about anuran declines has increased and it is now widely recognised that many species became extinct or decreased (Blaustein et al .1994). Conservation measures influenced the increase of the population size of Bufo calamita in Britain (John Buckley and Abstract: Lack of scientific data of Anuran populations in the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India, hampers in understanding the species richness. The present study of the assessment of Anuran population in the forest, agricultural and urban habitats of Tumkur district, from the year 2012 -13 revealed gradual differences in the distribution and size of these species. Adult frogs and toads were documented using Capture–Recapture and by Call survey methods. The larvae were counted using dip nets from the breeding sites. Seven Anuran species were recorded during the above period Duttaphrynus, Polypedates, Fejervarya, Hylo malabarica, Rana, Rachophorus and Kaloula taprobanica. The population size in the forest habitat was large compared to agricultural and urban habitats. The presence of anurans and habitat variables were subjected to ANOVA, Duncan Multiple regression and Karl Pearson correlation co-efficient test. Data analysis showed that anuran species in these habitats declined due to the consequences of anthropogenic activities. Hence there is an urgent need to develop conservation strategy for pool breeding and forest dwelling anurans.","Հայտնի է, որ արդյունաբերական թափոններով աղտոտված հողերի վերականգնման սովորական տեխնոլոգիաները թանկ են և կարող են իջեցնել հողի բերրիությունը: Նախկինում քաղաքային և արդյունաբերական թափոնները չէին մաքրվում, դրանցից ազատվում էին ուղղակիորեն՝ գետերը կամ օվկիանոսները լցնելով: Անգամ այսօր բազում մաքրման կայաններ բավարար կերպով չեն մաքրում աղտոտված հողերը, հատկապես այն կայանները, որտեղ անձրևաջրերը և կոյուղաջրերը համակցված են: Որոշ բուսատեսակներ հնարավորություն ունեն աճել և զարգանալ մետաղով հարուստ հողերում: Մետաղները, ի տաբերություն օրգանական միացությունների, չեն կարող քայքայվել և մաքրման համար, որպես կանոն, պահանջվում է դրանց հեռացումը: Այդ առումով տարբեր բույսերի վրա մեծ ազդեցություն ունեն կադմիումը (Cd) և կապարը (Pb): Կադմիումը կարող է կուտակվել բույսերում, առանց առաջ բերելու որևէ թունավոր ազդեցություն դրանց աճի վրա (Alkorta և մյուսն., 2004): Կադմիումը առկա է ցինկով աղտոտված շատ վայրերում: Տարբեր բույսեր` հնդկական մանանեխը (Brassica juncea), ուռենու (Salix) կլոնները, ալպիական կոտեմը (Thlaspi caerulescens), արևածաղիկը (Helianthus annus), եգիպտացորենը (Zea mays), համարվում են կադմիումի լավ կուտակիչներ: Կապարը աղտոտված միջավայրում առավել հաճախ հանդիպող ծանր մետաղներից է, այն հողի մեջ է մնում երկար ժամանակ, որոշ դեպքերում ընդհուպ մինչև 5000 տարի: Կապարով աղտոտման աղբյուրներ են հանդիսանում ավտոմեքենաները, մետաղամշակման գործարանները, հանքերը, երթևեկության արտանետումները, Pb-պարունակող ածխի այրումը, կապար պարունակող ներկերը, կապարով աղտոտված տիղմը և արդյունաբերական թափոնները (Friedland, 1990; Zakrzewski, 1991; Xiong, 1997, Xiong և մյուսն., 2001 և 2005): Մինչև 1980-ական թվականները գյուղատնտեսության ոլորտում որպես թունաքիմիկատ օգտագործվում էր կապարի արսենատը (LA) (Chisholm, 1972; Maclean և Langille, 1973): Բազմաթիվ բույսեր իրենց տարբեր մասերում կարող են կուտակել կապարը շատ բարձր կոնցենտրացիաներով: Brassica juncea-ն հողերի համար կարող է արդյունավետորեն օգտագործվել որպես ֆիտոռեմեդիատոր կապարի աղտոտման մինչև 500մգ Pb/1կգ հող չափով: Helianthus annus-ը և Zea mays-ը կարող են աճել հողում կապարի 16,000մգ Pb/1կգ կոնցենտրացիայի դեպքում (Spirochova և մյուսն., 2003): Հհետազոտությունները ցույց են տվել, որ Piptatherum miliaceum տեսակը կարող է օգտագործվել որպես հողի մեջ կապարի 300-ից 1500մգ PB/1կգ կոնցենտրացիայում մետաղական աղտոտման վերականգնիչ (Garcia և մյուսն., 2004): Thlaspi praecox-ը հողից կարող է կուտակել զգալի քանակությամբ Pb դրա 67.940մգ Pb/1կգ կոնցենտրացիայի դեպքում (Mikus և մյուսն., 2005): Hemidesmus indicus-ը արդեն ցույց է տվել կապարի արդյունավետ` 65% կուտակում` հողում դրա 10,000 մլգ/լ կոնցենտրացիայի դեպքում (Sekhar և մյուսն., 2005): Промышленные отходы, вероятно, представляют собой наибольшую проблему загрязнения почвы и воды. Эти загрязняющие вещества включают: (1) органические отходы, такие как растворители, нефтепродукты, пестициды; (2) неорганические отходы, такие как металлы, нитраты, фосфаты и многие неизвестные химические вещества. В отличие от органических соединений, металлы не могут разлагаться, и для очистки загрязненных почв, как правило, требуется их удаление. Обычные технологии восстановления являются дорогостоящими и могут ухудшить плодородие почвы, что привело бы к дальнейшим негативным последствиям для экосистем. \nНе смотря на то, что многие металлы имеют важное значение, их высокие концентрации токсичны, поскольку они создают свободные радикалы из-за окислительного стресса, большое их содержание в почве делают ее непригодной для роста растений и уничтожают биоразнообразие. Целью данного исследования было изучение влияния высокого содержания кадмия и свинца в почве на некоторые физиологические параметры трех видов деревьев (Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica и Fraxinus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia). Работы по данному исследованию выполнялись в Иранской Исламской Республике, в Научном центре сельского хозяйства и природных ресурсов, в 2011-2013 годах. Идея использования растений, накопляющих металлы, с целью удаления тяжелых металлов и других соединений из почвы, была впервые использована в 1983 году. Однако, концепция использования растений в очистке сточных вод, фактически, применяется в течении последних 300 лет (Hartman, 1975). Для того чтобы определить влияние структуры почвы на способность поглощения каждого отдельного вида (Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica и Fraxinus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia), было выбрано три различных состава почвы (глина, суглинок и песчаный суглинок). В указанные почвы были пересажены десятилетние саженцы трех указанных видов деревьев. Кроме того, были выбраны четыре различные концентрации тяжелых металлов: 1000млг/л, 2000млг/л, 3000млг/л, 4000млг/л, почва каждого контейнера для саженцев была доведена до ожидаемого уровня загрязнения, а также выделена контрольная почва (без искусственного загрязнения). В эксперименте использовалось 270 деревьев каждого вида (в целом - 810). В начале весны саженцы были высажены в загрязненные контейнеры, а затем, в конце осени листья, стебли и корни каждого саженца подверглись химическому анализу. Химический анализ проводился с помощью анализа ICP, а результаты были проанализированы соответствующим статистическим методом на основе модели распределения данных. Industrial wastes probably constitute the greatest single pollution problem in soil and water. These contaminants include (1) organic wastes such as solvents, petroleum products, pesticides, (2) inorganic wastes, such as metals, nitrate, phosphates and many unknown chemicals. Unlike organic compounds, metals cannot be degraded, and cleanup usually requires their removal. Most of the conventional remedial technologies are expensive and inhibit the soil fertility; this subsequently causes negative impacts on the ecosystem. Although many metals are essential, all metals are toxic at higher concentrations, because they cause oxidative stress by formation of free radicals. Another reason why metals may be toxic is that they can replace essential metals in pigments or enzymes disrupting their function. Thus, metals render the land unsuitable for plant growth and destroy the biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high Cadmium and Lead soil concentrations on selected physiological parameters of three species such as: Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica and Fraxinus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia. \nThe works of this study carried out in the Islamic Republic of Iran, at the Research Center of Agriculture and Natural Resources, in 2011-2013. The main results of the dissertation were discussed at 2013 in the Scientific advice of the Institute of Botany of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, at 25-26 December of 2013 in the Second international conference of agriculture and nature resources of Kermanshah, in Iran. The idea of using metal accumulating plants to remove heavy metals and other compounds was first introduced in 1983, but the concept has actually been implemented for the past 300 years for use plant in the treatment of wastewater (Hartman, 1975). In order to determine the effect of soil texture on the absorbance capacity of every species (Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica и Fraxinus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia), three different soils texture (clay, clay loam and sandy clay loam) would be chosen. And then ten one years old seedlings from every one of the three different species must be replant. Secondly four different heavy metal concentrations must be chosen as 1000ppm 2000ppm, 3000ppm, 4000ppm and control samples. Then soil of every seedling container must be raised to expected pollution level. Finally we have 270 seedlings per species and totally 810 ones. Seedlings would be treated by the pollutant in the first of spring and then leaves, stems and roots of every seedling would be sampled in the end of autumn. Chemical analysis must be done by ICP and results would be analyzed by suitable statistical design based on the data distribution model. Results of this study showed the maximum potential for cadmium and lead absorbing is belong to Robinia pseudoacacia, followed by Cupressus arizonica and Fraxinus rotundifolia. Soil texture has any effective role and all three textures (light, medium and heavy) in lead and cadmium absorption in all three species (Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica and Fraxinus rotundifolia) act the same. Soil acidity is one of the most important factors that affect on the absorption rate and in this study it has a narrow range between 7.15-7.4. \nHigh accumulation in the roots and stems of all three species in all concentration shows these species has high ability to lead and cadmium absorption and they aren't harmful at least to 4000 ppm. There is no significant deference between both of pollutant (lead and cadmium) absorption and all three species almost absorbed these pollutants equally. In all concentrations, stems and roots of Robinia pseudoacacia have the maximum lead and cadmium absorption. Due to the high absorption of lead and cadmium of these species (Robinia pseudoacacia, Cupressus arizonica и Fraxinus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia), they are suitable species for reforestation and urban green space.","Air pollution in large cities is one of the most serious ecological problems, because emissions always go into the atmosphere. One of the specific methods of pollution monitoring is lichen indication. The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of the atmospheric air of Chelyabinsk city (Russian Federation). The results were obtained from samples collected in June-July 2015. The trees for the lichen sampling were chosen from the areas with different pollution levels: relatively clean, moderately polluted, hardly polluted. For the purposes of the comparison lichens were measured in Ilmen reserve, as the protected relatively clean territory. Using the method of lichen indication mapping we identified an indicator species Parmelia sulcate. Based upon epiphytic lichen distribution in sampling areas we distinguished several zones of atmospheric pollution: polluted zone, relatively clean zone, the cleanest zone. Lichen biodiversity and their projective cover are stated to decrease as the anthropogenic load is increasing. In urban and anthropogenic environment lichen population density is declining more intensively than the number of species. Also we measured elemental composition of lichens by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. We have studied the presence of heavy metals. Zink oxide, chrome and mangan oxide rate in the samples from environmentally troubled areas near steel factories and the power plantis almost twice higher.","The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD, Kathmandu), with funding from the MacArthur Foundation, has recently performed a detailed analysis of the impacts of climate change on the Eastern Himalayas (Sharma et al. 2009). Their report focuses primarily on biodiversity and ecosystem services. As expected, the predictions are dire while the uncertainties remain large, given the paucity of serious attention to this region compared, for instance, to the Alps or even to the Andes. While the report notes the implications of climate change for human well-being, including health, infectious disease gets only passing mention (three paragraphs out of 25 pages). This is unfortunate because there is ample reason to expect that climate change in the Himalayas will lead to a significant increase in the regional infectious disease burden due, in particular, to vector-borne tropical diseases that have historically been absent from the Himalayas. The reasons are simple. First, climate change is likely to lead to a deterioration of water quality, partly because the increased initial meltdown and excess in water availability will be followed by a very significant reduction in supply. Resulting shortages of good quality water will increase the burden of diarrheal disease. Even cholera may emerge as a significant problem because of its known asso ciation with climate (Colwell 1996), and given its current incidence in some parts of the Indian Himalayas and Nepal. Second, there will also be a likely decrease in air quality, with a higher concentration of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and airborne-particles (the latter primarily in urban areas), and an increase in lower tropospheric and ground-level ozone levels, all leading to an increased frequency of cardio-respiratory disease. Third, and perhaps most important, systematic temperature increases (0.01–0.04oC per year, according to the ICIMOD scenarios) will allow tropical diseases to expand their range to higher elevations at which they did not occur before. These include a large spectrum of vector-borne (and, often, reservoir-dependent) diseases that have already begun to become problems in the region, including (visceral) leishmaniasis (locally known as kala-azar), dengue, and malaria. (The ICIMOD report also mentions schistosomiasis but it is unlikely that this disease will emerge as a major problem in the Himalayas given its very low frequency in neighboring regions.)","Temperature and patterns of precipitation are changing on a global scale. This has strong effects on many existing species, influencing the physiology, behavior and range of many populations. In contrast to these ecological effects of climate change, evolutionary responses to climate change are less well studied. With ongoing climate change, adaptation has recently become the focus of much ecological genomic research. Differences in climatic variables between environments influence the spatial distribution of phenotypic and genetic variation across a meta-population which can lead to local genetic adaptation. Thus, the detection of climate-mediated evolutionary responses can potentially shed light on the genetic basis of adaptation to climate change. Bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ) have a widespread distribution from western Europe into Scandinavia and western Russia, where they encounter a wide range of different climatic conditions. It is an important mammal species used to study the phylogeographic response of European fauna to climate change following the Last Glacial Maximum, but still little research has been done regarding adaptation to local climatic conditions in the bank vole. Therefore, the aim of our study is to uncover signatures of genetic adaptations to local climatic conditions among populations of bank voles. For this, we used a ddRAD sequencing approach and scanned the genome for signatures of genetic adaptations. Using this data, we report on population differentiation and the populations genetic structure of 14 bank vole populations distributed across Europe. By using a variety of tests we identify loci that are under putative selection showing a correlation between allele frequencies and climatic variation across the European continent. A previous rodent-trapping study at 16 high rise residential estates in Singapore demonstrated high levels of Rattus norvegicus activities in waste bin chambers that hold household waste discarded from the apartments. Situated on the ground level of apartment blocks, each chamber serves two columns of apartment blocks and is equipped with a floor trap which is connected to a network of sanitary lines that drains any waste water from the bin chambers. The rodents were observed to access bin chambers via damaged floor trap covers. Here we report a subsequent study on the activity and movement of rodents among the bin chambers and sanitary drain-lines. Passive infra-red hunting cameras were placed in bin chambers with rodent activities and adjacent inspection chambers to capture rodent activities. A capture-mark and release study was then conducted to track the movement of rodents in the sanitary-drain lines that serve the entire block of flats. During the 3 days of observations, the rodents were generally active from afternoon till early mornings, with spikes of activity recorded after lunch and dinner times of local residents. Our cameras did not detect movement of marked rodents to other infested bin chutes connected by the sanitary drain-line network. They were observed to move only between the bin chamber where they were caught and two closest inspection chambers, 2.5 m away. Further investigation with an industrial endoscope revealed that rodents were living in underground cavities below bin chambers with breached floor trap pipe. The study showed how rodents use man-made infrastructures to harbour and access food waste; and the importance of infrastructure design and maintenance in controlling the population of urban population of rodents. The effectivity of corridors connecting isolated patches has been investigated for more than three decades with animals of different species. It is already known that the presence and the properties of corridors are crucial for the species´ dispersal and mobility in a landscape. But corridor use may also depend on the behavioural traits of its users. Animal personality, i.e. consistent among-individual differences in behaviour, might affect the space use in general, but also the usage of corridors. We investigated whether the width of grass stripes and the personality of the individual are important for the corridor use of common voles ( Microtus arvalis ). If so, corridors may allow passage only for a proportion of individuals in a population and may thus affect individual mobility and population gene flow. We studied movement behaviour of male common voles in experimental grassland corridors of different width (1 m and 3 m). Voles were tested with established behavioural tests to parametrise boldness and activity. Automated and hand VHF telemetry was used to observe the individual movement of the tested animals (N=34) and to determine whether the animal perceives the structure as a corridor. Results on movement will be discussed in relation to animal personality and corridor width to allow predictions of dispersal abilities of personality types in habitats with different degrees of fragmentation. Gut microbes play key roles in maintaining physiological functions and health of their hosts. However, most studies on gut microbes are conducted in model systems under laboratory conditions. The response of gut microbiota to diet changes under field conditions has rarely been investigated. In this study, we utilize field and laboratory studies to test whether sheep grazing induces a diet shift and thus alters the gut microbiota of a small rodent species living in grassland. First, using a field enclosure experiment, we found that enclosures subjected to grazing were mostly dominated by Cleistogenes squarrosa (an unfavorable plant species for both sheep and voles), and that voles in grazing enclosures harbored gut communities with distinct microbial taxonomic composition and co-occurrence networks compared to those in control enclosures. Specifically, voles in grazing enclosures exhibited significantly lower abundances of Firmicutes , increased abundance of Bacteroidetes , and significant lower measurements of alpha diversity. PICRUSt analysis suggests a low mineral absorption capacity of the gut microbiome of voles from grazed enclosures. The microbiota from voles in the grazing enclosures had a smaller but more complex network with more positive interactions. We verified our findings using laboratory experiments where voles were exclusively fed either Cleistogenes squarrosa , Stipa krylovii or Leymus chinensis . We observed similar changes in the gut microbiome, confirming that the effects of sheep grazing on the gut microbiota of Brandt's voles were related to grazing-induced diet shifts. Our results provided evidence for a contribution of grazing-induced diet shift in changes of gut microbiota in Brandt’s vole, which in turn may explain the negative interaction between large domestic herbivore and small rodents in the field. Most research on small mammal decline has focused on limited spatial and temporal scales, especially for the Mediterranean region. To better understand this process, its causes and contexts, a broader spatio-temporal scale approach is needed. In our study we hypothesized that: I) small mammal assemblages are changed through time and that the primary cause is land use and climate change; II) the biodiversity indices of small mammals are related to landscape predictors, especially to a mosaic of natural and anthropogenically influenced habitats. We used a recent extensive dataset about distribution, abundance and traits of small mammals derived by common barn-owl ( Tyto alba ) pellets, covering a 30-year time spam. Through a framework of linear models we assessed the relationship between small mammal diversity (richness, Shannon index and functional diversity) and landscape variables (land use and landscape metrics) for 21 small mammal species (10 Rodentia and 11 Euliphlotypla ) occurring in a 10,000 km 2 area in central Italy. We also explored the variation trough time (1980 – 2017) of nine guilds (i.e. herbivore arboreal forager diurnal, herbivore ground forager diurnal, herbivore ground forager nocturnal, insectivore fossorial, insectivore ground forager diurnal, insectivore ground forager nocturnal, omnivore arboreal forager nocturnal, omnivore ground forager nocturnal, and omnivore ground forager diurnal) selected by a FMDA (factor analysis of mixed data) from 18 qualitative and quantitative functional traits. On a temporal scale, we found a significant decrease in richness and diversity for carnivore species, while omnivores increased significantly and herbivores did not show a trend throughout time. On a spatial scale, richness, diversity and functional diversity of small mammals were higher and positively related to heterogeneous landscape, especially in combination with land use coverage and spatial arrangement of patches affecting each diversity in different ways. Our study provided insights into the complexities of small mammal responses, with an emphasis on community-level changes and can serve as a foundation to predict shifts and trends for future scenarios. The common hamster ( Cricetus cricetus ) over the past fifty years dramaically decline in wild. Along with this, it began actively to settle in the cities. Urban areas are characterized by special environmental conditions. Animals that inhabit the city demonstrate a variety of adaptations, leaded to breeding strategy changes. In this connection, it is interesting to compare their reproductive strategy in the city and in the wild. During three years, we studied the structure of the urban population of the common hamster in the Gagarin park (Simferopol, Russia) on the plot of 2.2 hectares. In April 2016, during the peak of breeding activity, we observed 5 mating groups simultaneously. Each one has included one female and up to five males. Chasing and mating of males with females occurred several times during 2–3 hours. These observations allowed us to suppose a multiple paternity possibility. In the spring, 2017 in the city Park we fo","Ecosystem services delivered by natural ecosystems are increasingly important for climate change adaptation and mitigation and play a huge role in biodiversity conservation. For this reason, the EU has the ambitious goal of protecting at least 30% of land by 2030. Member states are called to improve and expand the network of protected areas within the next few years; to do so, scientific studies aimed at identifying areas with high ecological value, as well as at defining best management practices, are highly needed. In this study, we used the InVEST suite of models to spatially assess three regulating ecosystem services, that is, carbon storage, seasonal water yield, and urban flood risk mitigation in three administrative regions of central Italy. Using overlay analysis, we found areas with the highest delivery in each of the considered ESs; based on these findings, we eventually proposed four new protected areas, which combine for 888 km2, that is, 2.73% of the study area. Interestingly, each of the newly proposed protected areas has somehow been discussed and hypothesized by stakeholders, but only one is presumably going to be part of the national network of protected areas within the next years. Hopefully, by prioritizing areas according to the production of ecosystem services, this study can be intended as a step towards the systematic inclusion of ecosystem services studies for enhancing the network of areas under national protection schemes and achieving the goal of protecting at least 30% of land in Europe by 2030.","The present work explores the relationship between an urban road with both, socio-metabolic processes and natural systems patterns. The premise is that roads have a decisive impact on energy, material flows and connectivity between biological structures. Therefore, urban metabolism - Social and natural processes measured out of energy use, material flows and land use - becomes the appropriate instrument to assess and analyze the functionality of the different components operating in artificial and natural systems. The case study traces the metabolic behaviors that result from the cross of Juan Ponce de León Avenue through the water system composed by the estuary of Martin Peña and Río Piedras River. A theoretical framework based on social equity, economy, and ecology is being applied in data collection and analysis. Parametric methodologies and GIS information are used to describe the structural and functional properties of both natural and urban systems. The collected data enable the understanding that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-20th century to the present affects the resilience of the area. Consequently, this exploration demonstrates the importance of urban metabolism in maintaining the ecological quality of natural systems. As a result, it proposes an urban metabolism strategy to develop more sustainable urban schemes for the systems composed of urban roads and natural ecosystems. The organized complexity of the water system, necessary to host biodiversity and fundamental ecological processes, cannot be guaranteed if the urban metabolism is not taken into account.","Urban development is often confronted with a lack of available space. Brownfield sites offer great potential for sustainable urban planning because of their often-central location and the benefits associated with their redevelopment. Although the interest in brownfield regeneration has led to a lot of research on this topic, there is not yet a comprehensive review of brownfield research. In this review, we analyze the research on brownfields and provide a picture of the published case studies. We focus primarily on brownfields research in the United States, Europe, and China. This exploratory research is based on an analysis of the published scientific literature available in the Web of Science database. Initially used in North America, the term brownfield quickly became popular in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe. However, with the exception of the United States, there is no specific legislation for these sites; their protection is often based indirectly on directives or laws related to soil pollution, biodiversity or the environment. The perception of the potential use of brownfield sites varies considerably from one part of the world to another, and international collaborations between researchers from different parts of the world remain limited. Most of the described reuses of brownfield sites are forms of soft reuse (53%), and the type of reuse of a site depends more on the surrounding urbanization levels and the specific region than on the past use of a brownfield site. Despite the continued interest in the rehabilitation of these sites, especially due to the increasing demand for nature in the city following the Covid-19 crisis, many questions regarding the future of brownfield sites remain unanswered. The factors influencing their successful redevelopment are unclear, and further research is urgently needed to ensure a truly sustainable re-use of these sites.","This research conducted in the Institute of Technical / Mosul / Plant Production Department, using the method of analysis of spatial and temporal of the lands covered by the desertification in the province of Nineveh, which were Baaj, Al-Hadar, Telapta and Al-Shemal region . Was reached through a study that desertification is a form of degradation which affects lands in arid and semiarid regions such as Iraq, including Nineveh province, under the influence of natural factors ( environmental ) which is not suitable , such as climate factors , which include high temperature , atmospheric drought, low rate of relative humidity, intensity and direction of the wind in summer season , the high value of evaporation , drought of soil , low rates fall Raining in winter , the intensification of solar radiation ,high temperature, great warming disparity between winter and summer and between day and night , changes in atmospheric pressure , addition to the lack of water surfaces , drought of valleys . Thus these factors combined caused the demolition of the soil profile, the soil structure and the cohesion of the particles due to the demise of organic matter which associated the soil particles were represented by humus material, which leads to a decline in the productivity of the land and the impact on food security. Either human factors , they include in mainly form environmental pollution due to excessive exhaust of natural resources , loss of the phenomenon of the natural balance and self-renewal in the biosphere , not rationalize the consumption due to population increase , expansion of human activities , not applying the clean technology , increasing the use of polluted traditional energies , which produced the polluted matter as solid, liquid and gaseous which caused an imbalance in the ecosystem which is global warming, as well as the misuse of the land environmentally and mechanically in the cultivated operations of soil and crop with the following traditional irrigation methods which caused the increase of soil salinity also overgrazing non alternately, methods of deforestation , which forest is green belt , windbreaks to dust and sand storms . As a result of the interaction of environmental with human factors that the reaction is reflected in the form of the ecological imbalance called desertification. Through spatial analysis was evaluated the quality of desertification in the region the situation from medium to severe because the soil is still present despite the deterioration of soil fertility , loss of vegetation , low productivity but requires processed quickly otherwise become an a environmental disaster , because the speed of desertification in the region between 5-10 km / year , through the spatial analysis of desertification can be classified ; Baaj in first place Al-Hadar second place , Telapta third place and the Al-Shemal aspect region fourth place, where areas are represented above 20 %, an area of 1,385,843 dunum from total area of farmland on the level of province . This is clearly evident from the survey and spatial analysis, which caused the displacement, harmed (30000) human, in Baaj 134 village and (70) of the village population in others. The destruction of 75% of the livestock in addition to loss of biodiversity and degradation of soil and vegetation cover. Through the temporal analysis for areas covered by desertification can be seen that the time series between 1941-1985 was rainfall at; 338 ml / year. Can be conclude that during the 44 years the rate of precipitation is not suitable for the needs of agriculture , particularly crops of wheat , barley and natural grassland except with implemental irrigation , which did not witnessing the areas above then the phenomenon of desertification , where continued Londoner rates fall of rain water that reached 130 mm / year for the period of time confined between 1996 to 2000 where not harvested winter cereal crops , between 2002-2012 were the rainfall vibrant, through(11) years reached as average 303,7 ml/ y and the year 2013 increased the rainfall to 472,9 ml/ y ,through the past years increased temperatures rates , increased heat waves, hot days in summer as well as the irregular distribution rainfall , increased frequency of droughts ,increased their intensity in the region , was the very severe of drought in 2008 reached severity -2.48 by techniques of standard precipitation index (SPI) also increased sandstorms in terms of repetition and intensity reached 32 storm , as well as sintering heaven 71 days of dust thick , were critical stage in the water requirement for cereal crops in 2001 , either increased evaporation value in the year 2000 is the highest ,average of relative humidity 52% for years2002-2012,the falling dust was 13gm/m2/month in 2012 and suspended dust in atmosphere as average 1,394 microgram/m3, this was highest rate by comparison with Baghdad &amp;Basrah proninces.The result of non-stability of environmental status and vibrant raining through past years, where decreased groundwater recharge and their levels, also increased their salinity and degraded the quality . The negative impact of climate factors within the time series reflected negatively on soil and deteriorated their physical, chemical, and biological properties, causing desertification which negative reflected on winter farming production and vegetation cover. © 2016 Elixir All rights reserved.

Characterized the province by these environmental status over the past decades, but the province has seen in the last two decades a significant changes in its environmental as flora (cover vegetation) deteriorated , the soil lost their agricultural productivity became desertification threatens their territory. For importance of this environmental problem came interest to preparation this research to diagnose the causes and find appropriate solutions. Cover vegetation and forest is one of the effective environmental systems to achieve the natural balance in the biosphere include all plants, a trees and shrubs whether was natural or planting growing on the surface of the earth which is one of the ecological components, they are lung -breathing land so a source of food to all living organisms, cannot count the importance of vegetation cover it was a basic rule in the food pyramid for the living organisms, vegetation cover is one of the most important ecosystems in carbon dioxide gas absorption , production of the life Soul which was oxygen , prevent global warming , contribute to the filtering and rid the atmosphere from toxic gases this called self-purification or self-cleaning also to rid the air from dust , harmful suspensions and contributes to reduction of thermal difference between night and day , its contribution to the green environmental development so flow of energy to activate the relationship between decomposer , producer and consumer, so its ability to transform mineral soil elements to organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis by the action of solar energy, contributes to the preservation of moisture and the water cycle in the soil and release moisture to the atmosphere by process of transpiration of plants to bring rain, prevent drift and erosion of the soil , helps in regulate the wind and the movement of the clouds , rains and their distribution on the ground surface ,considers a source of food, clothing and medicine ,was base solid for many industries so for trees of forest were aesthetic , tourism and environmental value in maintaining for thermal balance, biodiversity also contributes to lowering temperatures, reduce wind speed and absorbs acoustic pollution .

Jerome A. Jackson, Department of Marine and Ecological Sciences, Florida Gulf Coast University, Ft. Myers, FL 33965. Before a bird hatches it is already responding adaptively to its environment and to other birds, at first instinctively, but later also as a result of learning. While our understanding of these responses is essential to our ability to carry out successful conservation efforts, that understanding is also sometimes shaped by perceptions arising from shortterm study, lack of an historical perspective, and preconceived notions arising from lack of insight. Aldo Leopold brought these ideas together suggesting in essence that we think too narrowly in scope and too short term. On the other hand, Margaret Morse Nice taught us to seek understanding through study of the intimate relationships among individuals. Marriage of these seemingly disparate perspectives is essential to sound conservation. Through this lecture I will celebrate the complexity of the interrelationships of woodpeckers and their physical and biotic environment to demonstrate the importance of both the longer view and the intimacy of social interaction to understanding and conservation. I will discuss the dynamic nature of social and habitat relationships inherent in concepts such as individual distance, differential niche use, home range, territoriality, old growth, and biodiversity, as well as problems that arise through misunderstanding of these relationships and concepts. HOW PHYLOGENIES CAN GUIDE RESEARCH IN OTHER FIELDS: EXAMPLES FROM HUMMINGBIRDS J. V. B, Jr., Museum of Natural Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA. Hummingbirds represent one of the most important model systems in research on birds. Not only do they exhibit spectacular species richness and ecological diversity, but they also approach the upper limits for vertebrate metabolism and physiological performance. They have also coevolved extensively with many plant taxa and are relatively easy to manipulate both in the field and in the laboratory. However, the tremendous potential for this group as a model for comparative biology has not been fully realized in part because of the absence of phylogenetic framework. Analysis of DNA sequence data (from 3 mitochondrial genes and two nuclear genes) from a diverse sample of Trochilidae (152 of 315 species sampled so far by the Jim McGuire lab) has produced a phylogenetic hypothesis that demonstrates the importance of phylogeny in guiding research in other fields. Examples are presented with respect to the evolution of sexual dimorphism, bill morphology, and biogeography. FLOCKING TO THE COAST: IMPLICATIONS OF RECENT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE GULF COAST FOR MIGRATING BIRDS. Jeffrey Buler*, Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, and Frank Moore, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS 39406. Along the northern Gulf coast, the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats due to rapid human population growth is at odds with the critical habitat needs for the millions of migrating birds that stop over here before and after crossing the Gulf of Mexico. To better understand the conservation implications of this conflict, we studied 1) the habitat use by migrating land birds at different spatial scales across this region using weather radar observations and ground surveys, 2) the movement and behavior of birds during stopover using radio telemetry, and 3) recent land cover changes along the Gulf coast. Migrants appear to respond to landscape structure before making landfall, preferring to stop over in landscapes dominated by hardwood forests (particularly bottomland hardwood forests) and avoiding landscapes dominated by non-forested land, such as agricultural fields, clear-cuts, and urban areas. However, the correlation between bird density and hardwood forest cover weakened with greater proximity to the coast. Moreover, land bird densities were highly-concentrated along the immediate coast out to about 25 km inland. Thus, migrants face strong extrinsic constraints on habitat use after negotiating the Gulf of Mexico during spring. Within Mississippi, the availability of hardwood forest habitat and the amount of protection these forests receive from human development declines with greater proximity to the coast. Additionally, the recent conversion of natural habitats for human land uses is greatest nearest the coast. Thus, our findings should increase the urgency for the conservation of forested coastal habitats for migrating birds. COASTAL ECOLOGY AND BIRD MIGRATION IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE. Kimberly R. Hall, Department of Forestry and Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824. Over the last 100 years, the average global surface temperature has increased approximately 0.8°C (1.4°F), and both the rate of warming, and the rate of sea level rise, are expected to continue to increase. Warming is associated with shifts in range boundaries (e.g., towards the poles) and shifts in timing (phenology), and both types of changes are likely to be seen in focal bird species, and in plants and insects that contribute to habitat quality for migrants in coastal habitats. Suites of climate change scenarios, paired with range change or energetic models, can help us to understand the relative probability of various types of changes, and to move forward with conservation planning in the face of uncertainty. A risk assessment framework is particularly helpful for understanding the role of climate change in determining the frequency of rare yet potentially catastrophic events, such as hurricanes. Impacts of sea level rise include habitat loss through inundation and erosion, as well as stronger storm surges that penetrate far inland where saltwater intrusion will affect the availability of fresh water. Predictive tools like spatial models allow us to visualize how the impacts of sea level rise will vary, highlighting places where impacts will be particularly strong, like the Mississippi Delta, where rapid subsidence is currently underway. To be effective over the long term, it is critical that strategies for protecting and restoring coastal habitats to benefit bird populations are developed with climate change in mind. ENDANGERED/THREATENED MIGRATORY BIRDS AND THE GULF COAST. Paul B. Hamel*, US Forest Service Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, Stoneville, MS 38776, and Melinda J. Welton, Gulf Coast Bird Observatory, Franklin, TN 37064. To determine the relative importance of factors in different portions of the annual cycle influencing the survival and successful reproduction of migratory birds with low populations or those designated as threatened or endangered requires leaps of faith. Application of theoretical constructs concerning demographic rates to specific cases must be done with limited and imprecise data. Each migrant poses its own set of social and political, as well as biological questions. A check of North American migrants listed as Threatened or Endangered yields a set of such cases, including Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Snowy (Charadrius alexandrinus) and Piping (C. melodus) Plovers, Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla), Bachman’s (Vermivora bachmanii), Golden-cheeked (Dendroica chrysoparia), and Kirtland’s (Dendroica kirtlandii) warblers, among others. Fortunately, to this point only one of the critically imperiled species, Peregrine Falcon, is a trans-Gulf migrant. Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), listed as Vulnerable by IUCN, provides an exemplar of the potential future for other species, including Swallow-tailed Kite (Elanoides forficatus), Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), and Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera). Comparison of Cerulean Warbler to the critically imperiled species yields insight into the influence of stopover habitat, not only on the northern Gulf Coast, but throughout the periphery of the Gulf, on fitness of migrants. Opportunities to reduce our ignorance through improved monitoring of movements, to improve habitats through management strategies, and to maintain particular elements in the landscape through protective conservation actions, exist throughout the basin. SCIENCE-BASED CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY BIRDS ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE GULF OF MEXICO Mark S. Woodrey*, Coastal Research and Extension Center, Mississippi State University, Biloxi, MS 39562, Wylie C. Barrow, Jr., National Wetlands Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Lafayette, LA 70506, William G. Vermillion and Mark W. Parr, Gulf Coast Joint Venture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lafayette, LA, 70506. The varied habitats found along the northern Gulf coast support a wide variety of North American birdlife for at least part of their annual cycle. Thus, this area is critical for science-based conservation efforts to protect, maintain, and increase existing bird populations. The Gulf Coast Joint Venture (GCJV) is the regionally based, biologically driven, landscape oriented partnership for the delivery of habitat conservation important to priority bird species from Brownsville, Texas, to Mobile Bay in Alabama. Its mission is to advance the conservation of important bird habitats within the GCJV region through biological planning, implementation of habitat conservation actions, and focused monitoring and evaluation of the planning and implementation processes. Currently, conservation planning efforts focus around four major bird groups: waterfowl, waterbirds, shorebirds, and landbirds. The GCJV‚s Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research Team (MERT), consists of working groups which address conservation planning for ","Freshwaters are closely linked with adjacent terrestrial ecosystems through reciprocal resource subsidies, which are fluxes of nutrients, organisms, and materials between ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems provide many resource subsidies to freshwaters including leaf litter, one of the most prevalent terrestrial-derived subsidies. Inputs of leaf litter fuel detritivores food web, as food resources and refuges, and affect nutrients cycling in freshwaters. The decomposition of leaf litter is subjected to many biotic and abiotic factors, which makes it a good indicator of freshwater ecosystem functioning. Yet, this ecosystem process has been affected by anthropogenic disturbances that alter abiotic and biotic factors in the nature. Therefore, this thesis aimed to investigate some previously under-investigated or unclear but important factors that may affect the decomposition of leaf litter in streams. First, I reviewed the importance of resource subsidy fluxes between riparian zones and freshwaters and how these subsidies can influence recipient ecosystems. Then, I conducted a field experiment exploring the effects of anthropogenic carrion subsidy (chicken meat) and environmental-relevant concentration of glyphosate (the most widely applied herbicides worldwide) on leaf litter decomposition and invertebrate communities colonizing in the leaf-litter bags deploying in streams with different types of land use. Next, I conducted a mesocosm experiment nearby an urban stream to investigate the effects of water temperature (~ 8 oC above vs ambient), consumer - snails (presence vs absence), and leaf-litter quality (intact vs &gt;40 % leaf area was consumed by terrestrial insects) on litter decomposition. Finally, I explored the global patterns of riparian leaf litter C, N, P, and their stoichiometric ratios to gradients of climatic (mean annual temperature and precipitation) and geographic (absolute latitude and altitude) factors, and the differences between biotic factors (phylogeny, leaf habit, N-fixing function, invasion status, and life form). The results of field experiment indicated that: in coarse mesh bags, glyphosate, carrion subsidy, and the addition of both decreased litter breakdown rates by 6.3 %, 22.6 %, and 24.3 % respectively; in fine mesh bags, glyphosate and the addition of both retarded litter breakdown rates by 8.3 % and 12.5 % respectively. Litter decomposition also differed among streams, with the highest breakdown rates in village streams and lowest in urban/suburban streams. Invertebrates were significantly different among streams, with biodiversity index and total taxon richness were highest in village streams and lowest in suburban stream. However, overall effects of carrion subsidy and glyphosate on macroinvertebrates were not significant. The results of mesocosm experiment indicated that warming and the presence of snails accelerated litter decomposition by 60.2 % and 34.9 % respectively, while litter breakdown rates of terrestrial insect damaged leaves were 5.1 % slower than intact leaves because of lower leaf litter quality. The results of meta-analysis study demonstrated that global riparian leaf litter had higher N and P, while lower C, C:N, and C:P ratios than terrestrial leaf litter in general. Riparian leaf litter quality changed with gradients of climatic and geographic predictors, and these patterns differed between leaf habits (evergreen or deciduous) and climate zones (tropical or non-tropical area). In general, my research provides important information on resource subsidy processes, which will benefit freshwater ecosystem management to support biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services.","Habitat fragmentation due to rapid urbanisation is occurring globally and results in small and often isolated patches of remnant bushland. These small, forest remnants contribute to the conservation of biodiversity within urban areas, as they can, and often do, contain suitable habitat structures. Habitat structures such as hollow-bearing trees are recognised as important features of forests globally. Therefore, the abundance of hollow-bearing trees within a landscape may be a controlling factor for many biota where no other habitat resources provide a feasible substitute. Therein, this thesis investigates five aspects in relation to the ecology of hollow-bearing trees as a habitat resource within a rapidly urbanising landscape.\nIn the first instance a review of the literature was undertaken. This presents a summary of the importance of hollow-bearing trees globally, and identifies threats associated with their conservation. Focus is centred on the importance of this habitat resource within the Australian context, concluding with a description of the study area and thesis aims. A hierarchical analysis of the current legislation that exists within Australia to protect hollowbearing trees was then undertaken. The evaluation revealed, that despite Federal and State legislation acknowledging the importance of hollow-bearing trees to biodiversity, there are insufficient mechanisms in place at all levels of government to halt the decline of hollowbearing trees across various landscapes.","Formulation of the problem. Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information.\n\nPurpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network.\n\nMethods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis.\n\nResults. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic.\n\nThe characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen.\n\nScientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined.\n\nPractical importance. Distinguished biocentres of Vinnytsia local ecological network will help preserve the biotic and landscape diversity of the city, maintain ecological balance of the city territory.","Taking the sub-basin region of water resource in the Liao River Basin as research area, land use data of the Liao River Basin in 1980 and 2000 were used to set up conversion matrix of each sub-basin region on GIS platform, and the temporal-spatial change characteristics of land use in the Liao River Basin was analyzed quantitatively. The results shows that farmland, woodland and grassland play a dominant role in the study area; During the period of 1980-2000, the main forms of land use conversion in the whole basin were the conversion from grassland and woodland to farmland, and in the Mainstream Liao River region and Huntai river region the conversion trend from farmland to construction land was obvious; The land use change in the West Liao River region and mainstream Liao River region made a significant contribution to the land use change of the Liao River Basin. Key words-Land use change; GIS; Liao River Basin Land use and cover change (LUCC) is closely related to the global environmental change, social production and lives (Wang et al., 2008). It not only brings great change of surface landscape structure, but also influences on material cycle and energy flow in the landscape level, and has a great impact on regional biodiversity and ecological process (Pan and Liu, 2005). In addition to that, LUCC has a direct effect to regional environment, for instance, soil erosion, land salinization, and water eutrophication (Yu et al., 2002). In 1995, International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP) initiated a joint project of land use and cover change (LUCC) (Turner et al., 1995), which has developed into the core of the global change research in the following years (Lambin et al., 2001; Hou and Cai, 2004; Currit and Easterling, 2008). As an important aspect of LUCC study (Li, 1996; Gao et al., 2001), dynamic monitoring is also used to analyze and assess land use and cover dynamic change at different scales, and can also provide basic information for studies on driving mechanism and resources environmental effects of LUCC, thus has been of significant importance in regional land use planning, biodiversity maintenance, and water resource protection (Pelorosso et al., 2001). Recently, the 3S (GIS, RS and GPS) techniques were integrated into LUCC research to reveal its temporal-spatial change regularities. Liu and Li (2007) analyzed the LUCC on watershed scale in six periods from 1954 to 2005 with the aid of RS and GIS techniques, and the effects of LUCC to Honghe Nature Reserve wetlands landscape has been studied systematically. Zhang et al. (2008) analyzed regional variation and spatial distribution features of LUCC in Nanman Banner of Inner Mongolia based on the four TM images of 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2005. Lowicki (2008) analyzed change area of agriculture land, forest land and settlement in the region of Wielkopolska(Poland) on GIS platform based on the data from satellite images, aerial photographs and land registers from 1989 to 2005. In general, current studies mostly focused on the LUCC characteristics from the aspect of time series, and less attention were paid to the change discrepancy from the difference of natural condition, economic level, intensity of human activities. in different regions. Liao River Basin is one of the seven greatest water systems in China. With the rapid development of social economy in recent years, land use and cover of it have been significantly changed. But at present there are no systematic quantitative researches into these changes. This paper quantitatively analyzed the temporal change characteristics of land use from 1980 to 2000 in each sub-region of the Liao River Basin, and compared the discrepancy of land use change in each region to find out temporal-spatial change characteristics of land use, as well as to supply scientific evidence for land use planning and management in watershed scale. I. STUDY AREA The Liao River Basin is located in the northeastern China across provinces Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the east longitude of 116°30′-125°47′, north latitude of 30°43′-45° and the basin area of 21.9×10km. It belongs to the continental monsoon climate area of temperate, warm-temperate and semi-humid zone, where annual average temperature is 4-9°C and annual average precipitation is between 350 and 1000mm and the precipitation from June to September accounts for more than 70% of annual precipitation; Natural flora distributes in three vegetation regions of Long White, North China and Inner Mongolia, and has distinct characters of transition and hybridity. The Liao River Basin consists of two water systems named Liao River and Huntai River, the lengths of 978-1-4244-2902-8/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 1 which are 1394km and 415.4km, respectively. According to the Master Water Resource Planning of the Liao River Basin, Liao River Basin is divided into four sub-basin regions, that is, the East Liao River region, West Liao River region, mainstream Liao River region and Huntai River region. II. MATERIAL AND METHODS A. Data Source and Basic Processing The 1:100,000 land use data of the Liao River Basin in 1980 and 2000 were derived from the Landsat TM images. In terms of the research purpose and basic data, landscape elements of the Liao River Basin were classified into six types, i.e., farmland, woodland, grassland, water area, construction land (urban and rural industrial and mining land, residential land) and unutilized land. With the graphic editing and spatial analysis functions of GIS, based on the vector data of water resource regions in the Liao River Basin, the land use map and attribute database of sub-basin regions in 1980 and 2000 were extracted. All the layers were stored in vector format, where information is defined by points, lines or polygons, and using Asia Lambert Conformal Conic projected coordinate systems as uniform map projection. B. Land Use Conversion Matrix Using the spatial analysis functions of GIS, land use maps of each sub-basin region in 1980 and 2000 were overlaid on ArcGis9.0 platform to obtain land use-change maps of each region. Then land use conversion matrixes from 1980 to 2000 of each sub-basin region were established in accordance with the attribute fields (Tables I-IV). With the aid of conversion matrix, the internal changes of every land use type were analyzed to reflect the dynamic change process of land use in each sub-basin region. Taking relative change rate (Liu et al., 2007) to represent the extent to which land use type changed in the ( 1 k + )th period compared with the k th period:","With around 85% of Australia’s population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels and increasing storm surges will continue to have significant impacts on many of the continent’s coastal communities and landscapes. This presents great challenges to urban planners, urban designers and landscape architects responsible for creating safe, functional, and robust built environments for coastal communities. In preparation for sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise, nature-based solutions and soft ecosystem-driven approaches are increasingly considered at the micro scale of design, but less explored at the planning level.\nThis research investigates the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) at the planning level for a proposed development project in the coastal city of Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, Victoria. We examine whether the draft strategic plan for the redevelopment of Point Henry-Moolap coastal area in Geelong, incorporates principles of nature-based approaches to address projected impacts of coastal climate change. A brief review of coastal management policies in Victoria is provided. An analysis framework derived from NBS principles is used to identify concepts within the development framework plan that are aligned with NBS and ecosystems-based approaches. From the analysis, areas that provide opportunities for a better integration of NBS in coastal planning and responding to future climate-induced impacts are identified.We conclude that providing clearer directions, including regulatory instruments in high level land use planning, can help local governments and developers make informed decisions that consider human well-being, biodiversity and climate change.\nWith Australia’s global premises of coastal population growth, and increasing impacts of climate change on coastal areas, this research provides a timely contribution aligned with current social and ecological challenges.","Human activities, including urbanization, continue to result in species extinction and threatening the biodiversity on which life depends. This prompted landscape architects to focus on creating more urban parks that are naturalistic. This could help to enhance \n biodiversity by increasing the variety of plants and wildlife in urban areas. However,some studies have cautioned that urban public may consider naturalistic landscapes to be unsafe and perceived safety influence urbanites willingness to use parks. Previous studies have shown the influence of visual characteristics on perceived safety. However,there is a dearth of systematic studies on the relationship between landscape visual \n characteristics and perceived safety of naturalistic landscapes in urban parks. This study aimed to fill in this gap through the following objectives: 1) To examine public perceptions of safety; 2) To determine perceived safety according to visual characteristics; and 3) To determine the factors that influence perceived safety. \n This study involved the selection and testing of naturalistic scenes in urban parks. The visual characteristics measured included Prospect, Refuge and Escape (each was measured by three indicators). Visual characteristics were also described verbally in the \n questionnaire. The study used photo-questionnaires of naturalistic landscapes in urban parks in Klang Valley, Malaysia. They were administered to 360 undergraduate students from Universiti Putra Malaysia in Serdang, Selangor. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as Repeated Measure ANOVA,correlation and regression analysis. \n Results indicated that there is a significant difference between respondents’ perceived safety for different visual characteristics, even when the effect of non-visual factors (concerns about dangers, together with personal characteristics and experiences) was \n removed. Perceived safety for Refuge was lower than that for Prospect and Escape. The results revealed that the perceived safety for Prospect, Refuge and Escape are predictors of perceived safety for naturalistic landscapes. Significant relationship between photographs and verbal statements of measures of perceived safety confirmed the validity of the constructs.. Results also indicated violent crime and social incivilities \n successfully predicted perceived safety. In terms of demographic variables only ethnicity influenced the perceived safety of participants. \n This study showed that perceived safety is a complex issue involving several elements,both physical and social. Therefore, physical and social measures should be combined in strategies to improve safety. This information can be useful for landscape planners, \n designers and authorities in the design and management of naturalistic landscapes in urban parks that are perceived to be safe by users.","The aim of this paper is to analyze the problem of artificial reefs, to warn to the need for definition of such facilities in the national legal framework and in the context of urban ecology, present their potential for the marine environment. A review and analysis of national legal frameworks and European regulations regarding the possibilities of their establishment and management is given, all towards to reduce the eutrophication process, the increase of the fish stock and the creation of a zone for the prohibition of fishing in order to protect the coastline and enable the renewal of marine biodiversity and ecosystems in Republic of Croatia.","Landscape fragmentation in Europe \nLandscape fragmentation caused by transportation infrastructure and built-up areas has a number of ecological effects. It contributes significantly to the decline and loss of wildlife populations and to the increasing endangerment of species in Europe, for example through the dissection and isolation of populations, and affects the water regime and the recreational quality of landscapes. In spite of the planning concept of preserving large unfragmented areas, fragmentation has continued to increase during the last 20 years, and many more new transportation infrastructure projects are planned, in particular in eastern Europe, which will further increase the level of landscape fragmentation significantly. Therefore, data on the degree of landscape fragmentation are needed that are suitable for comparing different regions, especially in relation to different natural landscape types and different socioeconomic conditions. This report quantitatively investigates the degree of landscape fragmentation in 28 countries in Europe for the first time for three different fragmentation geometries \nat three levels. The three levels include countries, regions (NUTS-X, according to the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units), and a grid of 1 km2 cells (LEAC grid, which is used for Land and Ecosystem Accounting activities). \n \nThe report applies the method of 'effective mesh density' which quantifies the degree to which the possibilities for movement of wildlife in the landscape are interrupted by barriers. The effective mesh density values across the 28 investigated countries cover a large range, from low values in large parts of Scandinavia to very high values in western and central Europe. Many highly fragmented regions are located in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Poland and the Czech Republic. High fragmentation values are mostly found in the vicinity of large urban areas and along major transportation corridors. The lowest levels of fragmentation are usually associated with mountain ranges or remoteness. Fragmentation geometry B2 'Fragmentation of non-mountainous land areas' which includes highways up to class 4, railways and urban areas, is the most important fragmentation geometry, as it is suitable for comparing regions with differing geographical conditions like different amounts of mountains or lakes; it also encompasses the most complete set of physical barriers that may affect a large number of species. \n \nPredictive models of landscape fragmentation \nIn the second part, this report investigates potential causes that contribute to an increased or decreased degree of landscape fragmentation and determines their relative importance. The density of the transportation network and the extent of landscape fragmentation are largely a function of interacting socioeconomic drivers such as population density and geophysical factors such as topography. \nCurrent levels of landscape fragmentation need to \nbe interpreted within the context of these regional socioeconomic and geophysical conditions. Therefore, this report applies a set of statistical models to determine which of these factors drive the process of landscape fragmentation in Europe. We analysed the statistical relationships between landscape fragmentation and a range of predictive variables, applied these relationships to predict the likely fragmentation values for all regions in our study area, and compared actual values with predicted values. \nIn general, the most relevant variables affecting landscape fragmentation were population density, gross domestic product per capita, volume passenger density, and the quantity of goods loaded and unloaded per capita. The amount of variation in the level of fragmentation that was explained by the predictor variables was high, ranging from 46 % to 91 % in different parts of Europe. The statistical relationships indicated that different drivers of landscape fragmentation are important in different parts of Europe. Efforts for curtailing landscape fragmentation should take these differences into account. \n \nRelevance for monitoring systems and policymaking \nThe results demonstrate that there is an urgent need for action. Large discrepancies between predicted and observed fragmentation values provide a basis for identifying areas for prioritising management action. Such data also provide a starting point for scenarios for the future development of landscape fragmentation in Europe. There is an increasing need and interest in including indicators of landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems of sustainable development, biodiversity, and landscape quality. We recommend that the results presented in this report be used for this purpose and be updated on a regular basis to detect trends in the development of landscape fragmentation. Therefore, this report discusses the use of fragmentation analysis presented in this report as a tool for performance review in transportation planning and regional planning and recommends a set of measures to control landscape fragmentation, such as more effective protection \nof remaining unfragmented areas and wildlife corridors, the setting of targets and limits and a European defragmentation strategy. This study provides for the first time an accurate measurement of landscape fragmentation for most of the European continent, which supports managers \nand policymakers in allocating resources towards the protection and restoration of biodiversity and landscape quality. The report also identifies future research needs.","The Climate Change Adaptation for Natural Resource Management (NRM) in East Coast Australia Project aims to \nfoster and support an effective “community of practice” for climate change adaptation within the East Coast Cluster \nNRM regions that will increase the capacity for adaptation to climate change through enhancements in knowledge \nand skills and through the establishment of long‐term collaborations. It is being delivered by six consortium research partners: \n \n* The University of Queensland (project lead) \n \n* Griffith University \n \n* University of the Sunshine Coast \n \n* CSIRO \n \n* New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage \n \n* Queensland Department of Science, IT, Innovation and the Arts (Queensland Herbarium). \n \nThe project relates to the East Coast Cluster, comprising the six coastal NRM regions and regional bodies between \nRockhampton and Sydney: \n \n* Fitzroy Basin Association (FBA) \n \n* Burnett‐Mary Regional Group (BMRG) \n \n* SEQ Catchments (SEQC) \n \n* Northern Rivers Catchment Management Authority (CMA) (NRCMA) \n \n* Hunter‐Central Rivers CMA (HCRCMA) \n \n* Hawkesbury Nepean CMA (HNCMA). \n \nThe aims of this report are to summarise the needs of the regional bodies in relation to NRM planning for climate \nchange adaptation, and provide a basis for developing the detailed work plan for the research consortium. \nTwo primary methods were used to identify the needs of the regional bodies: \n \n(1) document analysis of the existing NRM/ Catchment Action Plans (CAPs) and applications by the regional bodies for funding under Stream 1 of the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund, and; \n \n(2) a needs analysis workshop, held in May 2013 involving \nrepresentatives from the research consortium partners and the regional bodies. \n \nThe East Coast Cluster includes five of the ten largest significant urban areas in Australia, world heritage listed \nnatural environments, significant agriculture, mining and extensive grazing. The three NSW CMAs have recently \ncompleted strategic level CAPs, with implementation plans to be finalised in 2014/2015. SEQC and FBA are beginning \na review of their existing NRM Plans, to be completed in 2014 and 2015 respectively; while BMRG is aiming to \nproduce a NRM and Climate Variability Action Strategy. The regional bodies will receive funding from the Australian \nGovernment through the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund (NRM Fund) to improve regional planning \nfor climate change and help guide the location of carbon and biodiversity activities, including wildlife corridors. The bulk of the funding will be available for activities in 2013/2014, with smaller amounts available in subsequent years. \n \nMost regional bodies aim to have a large proportion of the planning work complete by the end of 2014. In addition, \nNSW CMAs are undergoing major structural change and will be incorporated into semi‐autonomous statutory Local Land Services bodies from 2014. Boundaries will align with local government boundaries and there will be significant \nchange in staff and structures. \n \nThe regional bodies in the cluster have a varying degree of climate knowledge. All plans recognise climate change as \na key driver of change, but there are few specific actions or targets addressing climate change. Regional bodies also \nhave varying capacity to analyse large volumes of spatial or modelling data. Due to the complex nature of natural \nresource management, all regional bodies work with key stakeholders (e.g. local government, industry groups, and \ncommunity groups) to deliver NRM outcomes. Regional bodies therefore require project outputs that can be used \ndirectly in stakeholder engagement activities, and are likely to require some form of capacity building associated \nwith each of the outputs to maximise uptake. \n \nSome of the immediate needs of the regional bodies are a summary of information or tools that are able to be used \nimmediately; and a summary of the key outputs and milestone dates for the project, to facilitate alignment of \nplanning activities with research outputs. \n \nA project framework is useful to show the linkages between research elements and the relevance of the research to \nthe adaptive management cycle for NRM planning in which the regional bodies are engaged. A draft framework is \nproposed to stimulate and promote discussion on research elements and linkages; this will be refined during and \nfollowing the development of the detailed project work plan. The regional bodies strongly emphasised the need to \nincorporate a shift to a systems based resilience approach to NRM planning, and that approach is included in the \nframework. \n \nThe regional bodies identified that information on climate projections would be most useful at regional and subregional \nscale, to feed into scenario planning and impact analysis. Outputs should be ‘engagement ready’ and there \nis a need for capacity building to enable regional bodies to understand and use the projections in stakeholder \nengagement. \n \nThere was interest in understanding the impacts of climate change projections on ecosystems (e.g. ecosystem shift), \nand the consequent impacts on the production of ecosystem services. It was emphasised that any modelling should \nbe able to be used by the regional bodies with their stakeholders to allow for community input (i.e. no black box \nmodels). \n \nThe online regrowth benefits tool was of great interest to the regional bodies, as spatial mapping of carbon farming \nopportunities would be relevant to their funding requirements. The NSW CMAs identified an interest in \ndevelopment of the tool for NSW vegetation types. \nNeeds relating to socio‐economic information included understanding the socio‐economic determinants of carbon \nfarming uptake and managing community expectations. A need was also identified to understand the vulnerability of \nindustry groups as well as community to climate change impacts, and in particular understanding how changes in the \nflow of ecosystem services would interact with the vulnerability of these groups to impact on the linked ecologicalsocio‐economic system. Responses to disasters (particularly flooding and storm surge) and recovery responses were also identified as being of interest. \nAn ecosystem services framework was highlighted as a useful approach to synthesising biophysical and socioeconomic \ninformation in the context of a systems based, resilience approach to NRM planning. A need was identified to develop processes to move towards such an approach to NRM planning from the current asset management approach. Examples of best practice in incorporating climate science into planning, using scenarios for stakeholder engagement in planning and processes for institutionalising learning were also identified as cross‐cutting needs. \n \nThe over‐arching theme identified was the need for capacity building for the NRM bodies to best use the information \navailable at any point in time. To this end a planners working group has been established to support the building of a network of informed and articulate NRM agents with knowledge of current climate science and capacity to use \ncurrent tools to engage stakeholders in NRM planning for climate change adaptation. The planners working group \nwould form the core group of the community of practice, with the broader group of stakeholders participating when \nactivities aligned with their interests. In this way, it is anticipated that the Project will contribute to building capacity within the wider community to effectively plan for climate change adaptation.","Biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems is declining due to increasing anthropogenic pressure. Urban and agricultural expansion lead to shrinking natural or seminatural habitats. In addition, management intensification of existing agricultural land further reduces the quality of agroecosystems as habitat for many species. Both, local reduction of plant diversity and the regional degradation of seminatural vegetation have consequences for consumer species. The consequences of plant species loss for the diversity of consumer species and ecosystem functioning have been addressed over the past decades in numerous studies, ranging from controlled experiments with manipulated plant communities to systems with natural occurring gradients in plant diversity on a local and landscape scale. These studies have found that plant and habitat diversity can have cascading effects on the faunal community, shift its trophic structure and influence species-mediated ecosystem-processes, such as predation. Although it is clear that interspecific interactions are the drivers of such community shifts and ecosystem processes, our knowledge on how changing diversity of basal resources impacts species interactions is currently still limited. \nThe major aim of my thesis was to contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of plant diversity on the multitude of interactions that species in complex communities are involved in. This thesis focuses on interactions of mobile generalist omnivores and predators that can be found across the whole gradient from natural to strongly modified habitats. Although this group of invertebrates may not be particularly threatened by the loss of plant diversity, they are of great interest as model organisms, because their dietary plasticity allows them to interact with different sets of co-occurring species in their local environment. A further aim of my thesis was to expand the focus from trophic to non-trophic interactions by including microorganisms in my studies that are, despite their tremendous diversity and importance for many ecosystem functions, rarely considered in the analysis of aboveground interactions. \nIn the first research chapter (chapter 2), I studied the effects of landscape context on the gut bacterial community and body condition of predatory insects (lady beetles) in a mensurative experiment in the Midwest of the USA. Insects were sampled across a landscape complexity gradient (increasing amount of cropland), and across two field types with a pronounced difference in plant diversity (soybean monocultures vs. restored prairies). Unexpectedly, predators collected in soybean fields had a more diverse set of gut microbes than predators from prairies. However, predators from soybean had lower fat content than predators collected in prairies, suggesting greater resource availability in prairies. Whether the lady beetle species were native or exotic to the USA influenced the effect of landscape context, suggesting differences in foraging preferences between these groups at a landscape scale. Another key finding was that lady beetle species have distinct microbial communities. Overall, my study highlights complex interactions among gut microbiota, predator identity, and landscape context. \nThe studies in chapter 3 and 4 were conducted within the framework of a biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) with manipulated taxonomic and functional plant diversity to study if plant diversity per se has an impact on microbial and trophic interactions involving invertebrates. In a pilot study (chapter3), I evaluated metabarcoding of gut contents of invertebrates as a novel approach to analyze biotic interactions in species-rich communities. In an extended study spanning the full experimental design (chapter 4), I subsequently used this approach to analyze DNA of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria in gut contents of three invertebrate species that vary in their degree of omnivory. The results the richness and composition of detected taxa is only little affected by plant diversity directly and mainly driven by indirect effects of plant diversity via the performance of the plant or animal community. A key finding was that vegetation cover shifts the trophic position of omnivores but the direction of the effects depended on the species identity of the omnivore. Further, the consumers were associated with different sets of animal and microbial taxa, reflecting their different food preferences. \nThe final research chapter (chapter 5) assessed the efficiency of pitfall trapping, which is one of the most frequently used approaches to assess aboveground invertebrate diversity, under different scenarios by employing an ecological simulation approach. An individual-based model for simulating the movement and pitfall trap sampling of arthropods was developed and factors that are assumed to affect the trapping efficiency were systematically assessed at the species and community level. Body mass, temperature, and pitfall trap number strongly increased the sampling efficiency. This has implications on the study of communities, as the strong impact of body mass could result in an overestimation of large-sized species in the arthropod community and imply wrong conclusions about its trophic structure. It is therefore proposed to conduct a bias correction and a correction factor that requires only information on species body mass is provided to derive reliable abundance estimates from pitfall trap sampling. \nThis thesis revealed that species interactions are driven by a multitude of direct and indirect effects of plant diversity on a local and landscape scale. This is further complicated by the contrasting responses of consumer species that are often treated as one functional group and highlights the need to further investigate the response of individual key species instead of focusing solely on whole communities. Overall, my thesis is a first step to integrate novel approaches that allow the empirical assessment of multi-level species interactions into biodiversity research.","The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased since the pre-industrial era due to human activities, primarily the combustion of fossil fuels and changes in land use and land cover. These, together with natural forces, have contributed to changes in the Earth’s climate (both mean and variability) over the twentieth century; land and ocean surface temperatures have warmed, the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation have changed, sea level has risen, and the frequency and intensity of El Niño events have increased. These changes have affected wetlands and their biota, especially in coastal and high latitudes, including the timing of reproduction of species, migration of animals, the length of the growing season and the frequency of pest and disease outbreaks. The Earth’s mean surface temperature is projected to warm by 1.4 to 5.8 ̊C by the end of the twenty-first century, with land areas warming more than the oceans, and high latitudes warming more than the tropics. Sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m, and is expected to have further effects on wetlands and their biota either directly (e.g. through changes in sea level and/or increased temperatures) or indirectly (e.g. through changes in hydrology, fire regime and pest outbreaks). These changes will increase the risk of extinction of vulnerable species, and could drastically alter the migration patterns of many others. Populations of some species will decline, whilst some will increase in both size and distribution. The consequences of climate change and variability for waterbirds is likely to be large, but our understanding of the role of climate change versus all the other changes due to human activities (such as changes in land use and land cover, drainage, invasive species etc.) is undermined by the limited extent of our data and existing knowledge. In all but a few cases, the data are totally inadequate. As many wetland habitats and waterbird species are currently under great pressure, we propose that quantitative risk assessments of individual and multiple pressures at multiple sites along flyways and at major wetlands are undertaken as a basis for developing adaptation options for these species and ecosystems. INTRODUCTION We present an overview of the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report on climate change and its impacts on wetlands, in particular the information and graphics provided by IPCC (2001 &amp; 2002). We also draw on a paper on climate change and wetlands prepared for the 8th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (van Dam et al. 2002) and recent analyses of the observed and projected effects of climate change on waterbirds. It is well recognized that at the global level, human activities have caused, and will continue to cause, a loss and/or a change in biodiversity in general. More specifically, biodiversity in wetlands has been affected by, inter alia, changes in land use and land cover, soil and water pollution and degradation, air pollution, diversion of water to intensively managed ecosystems and urban systems, habitat fragmentation, selective exploitation of species, introduction of non-native species, and stratospheric ozone depletion. It is also well recognized that climate change will constitute an added stress that may act synergistically or cumulatively and further adversely affect biodiversity. In turn, given that wetland biodiversity supports or provides many ecosystem services on which many humans depend (see review by Finlayson &amp; D’Cruz 2005), changes in wetland biodiversity will undoubtedly also affect human well-being. We therefore consider climate variability and change in the context of global change that encompasses all pressures from human activities. We specifically look at some of the impacts on waterbirds and then look at possible response options (or adaptation options) through a risk assessment framework. The paper covers: 1 climate variability and change, and its impact on wetlands; 2 observed changes in the distribution of specific waterbird species in response to climate variability and change, and changes in land and water use; and 3 a risk analysis framework to develop responses that address the impacts of multiple pressures, including climate change, on wetlands. CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACT ON WETLANDS We summarize the following: 1 changes that have been observed in the biophysical systems (atmosphere, oceans) and the role of human activities in those changes; 2 the (observed) impacts of these changes on biological systems and especially wetlands; and 3 the role that adaptation can play in responding to these changes. Observed changes in biophysical systems During the period 1750-2000, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased (Fig. 1): carbon dioxide by Climate variability and change and other pressures on wetlands and waterbirds: impacts and adaptation C.

The results of global climate change have been registered all over the world as progressive warming with fast heat waves, accelerated glacier ice melting, variations in the global ocean streams and heat balance, droughts and lack of drinking water, damage to plants and animals. Mathematical modeling of the water exchange in local ecosystems is a very important constituent of detailed analysis of different scenarios of water availability at various trends in the weather change. \nThe work is aimed at mathematical modelling of water balance in an urban ecosystem accounting for global climate changes. A brief review of the models is presented, and a synthetic model for the water balance on the urban territory of Kharkiv city (Ukraine) based on the statistical dependencies, compartmental system dynamics approach and hydrological equation with probabilistic description of the input parameters is developed. The monthly and year averaged temperature and precipitation curves, time series on downpours, droughts and storms over the Kharkiv region and Kharkiv city during 1908−2012 years were collected from the open databases and analyzed. Gradual increase in the annual temperature was confirmed. \nDifferent scenarios of the regional development (population growth and industry development with increased water demands) and weather changes were tested, and availability of water has been estimated. It was established by numerical simulations, the water insufficiency in the region in 2040 could reach 10−17 % if the mean annual air temperature increases in 0.5−2.5 °T. This will cause damage for plants, animals, and human health. The obtained results are important for decision making by official planning authorities and regional administration","Estuaries - one of the most vulnerable ecosystems globally - face anthropogenic threats, including biodiversity loss and the collapse of sustainable fisheries. Determining the factors contributing to the maintenance of estuarine biodiversity, especially that of fish, is vital for promoting estuarine conservation and sustainability. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis to determine fish species composition in 22 estuaries around Japan and measured watershed-scale land-use factors (e.g., population size, urban area percentage, and forest area percentage). We sought to test the hypothesis that the richness of the most vulnerable estuarine fish species (i.e., registered by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment in the national species red-list) is determined by watershed-scale land-use factors. The richness of such species was greater where forest cover was highest; thus, forest cover contributes to their conservation. The proportion of agriculture cover was associated with low species richness of red-listed fishes (redundancy analysis, adjusted R2 = 43.9% of total variance, df = 5, F = 5.3843, p = 0.0001). The number of red-listed species increased from 3 to 12 along a watershed land-use gradient ranging from a high proportion of agriculture cover to a large proportion of forest cover. Furthermore, the results showed that throughout Japan all the examined watersheds that were covered by &gt;74.8% forest had more than the average (6.7 species per site) richness of red-listed fish species. This result can be attributed to the already high average forest cover in Japan of 67.2%. Our results demonstrate how the land use of watersheds can affect the coastal sea environment and its biodiversity and suggest that proper forest management in conjunction with land-use management may be of prime importance for threatened fish species and coastal ecosystems in general.

It examines how these tools can significantly improve the synthesis and availability of existing marine mammal data in different ocean regions, using two case studies, the Mediterranean Sea and the Southwest Pacific Ocean. This analysis provides evidence for the first time that these science tools, which have been designed to capture marine mammal data at the maximum possible degree, if combined and fully integrated can attain a more comprehensive view of the dynamic nature of marine mammals, especially in relevance to their migratory habits, providing more robust knowledge on marine biodiversity in data poor areas including in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. 2 Gloria G. Aldana (EEP) Advised by: Lori Bennear &amp; Lydia Olander Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Green Infrastructure Project for Water Management in Peru The purpose of this research is to analyze the costs and benefits of a green infrastructure project in Peru in comparison to a traditional microreservoir. Green infrastructure entails restoring an ecosystem for storm water management. In this case, cattle will be excluded from an overgrazed area in Huamantanga, Peru. Cattle exclusion is expected to allow for soil decompression. Once the begins to decompress, alfalfa can be grown as cattle pasture and reduce erosion. Together, these effects would increase water storage in the wet season and reduce flooding downstream. The water stored may then be used for irrigation of alfalfa in the dry season. The main economic benefit being studied is the additional income from artisanal cheese production in Huamantanga as a result of the augmented water flow in the dry season. This research will contribute information to the sparse existing green infrastructure literature. Elizabeth C.

This paper examines key trends in the midstream MLP space through broad market analysis and focused case studies to explain why the MLP model has been a successful vehicle for aggregating capital and encouraging infrastructure investment. Despite the growing use of MLPs since the 1980s, market capitalization, new IPOs, and number of existing MLPs are down from the peak years of 2013 and 2014. Through an analysis of several recent “roll-ups” and simplification transactions, we identify issues in the MLP model that may affect its success moving forward. Last, this paper considers the recent Hess Midstream IPO to identify in what cases the traditional MLP model may still prove to be successful moving forward. Danielle Arostegui (EEP) Advised by: Lori Bennear Group Members: Rachel Brinks, Ryan Callihan, Leah Louis-Prescott, Lauren Mechak Recommendations for Implementing a Carbon Tax in Boulder, Colorado Boulder, Colorado, a small city located approximately 30 minutes outside of Denver, has historically funded its Climate Action Plan through a tax on electricity (“CAP tax”). In addition to generating revenue, the CAP tax serves as a carbon pricing mechanism. With the CAP tax expiring in 2023, this report examines what updates the city could make to the tax so it: 1) continues to generate revenue, 2) incorporates other fuels such as natural gas, and 3) better reflects the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions. We provide recommendations and next steps to the city based on our analysis of the city’s regulatory authority, research on worldwide carbon pricing systems, and quantitative model results. We find that a charge reflecting the full social cost of carbon (~$42 in 2020) could greatly increase revenue beyond historical CAP tax levels, and that incorporating the natural gas sector at a lower rate could provide long-term funding stability for the city. Susana Arredondo (DEL) Advised by: David Hinton Public Acceptance of Pure Water Soquel, A Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project WaterReuse (recycled wastewater for drinking) is proven to be safe technology for drinking. However, public acceptance of drinking highly purified wastewater can still be hard to swallow. In California, water providers like Soquel Water District must be forward-thinking and secure drinking water sources. With climate change causing seawater intrusion and over drafting of the groundwater, this is impacting the fresh drinking water to the area. A solution is to replenish the groundwater with recycled wastewater to prevent sea water intrusion and increase water quality. But first, public acceptance must be understood, and more importantly at the communitybased level. Soquel Water District operates a Mobile Learning Center Trailer and an on-site Learning Center. Each center is equipped with visual aids but no on-site pilot study. After being toured, this project measured the change in public acceptance. Why is this project valuable? Smaller water reuse projects will be more common and require less funding in the long run. This project answers how effective visual aids are to gain public acceptance of recycled wastewater for drinking and has turned the dial on this new water source. In California, this new paradigm of drinking recycled wastewater is here, and here to stay but only with the help of public acceptance to support sustainable water resources. Madeline A. Atkins (WRM) Advised by: Jeff Hughes &amp; Martin Doyle The State of Water and Wastewater Utility Debt in North Carolina Over the next 20 years, North Carolina water and wastewater systems will require up to $26 billion in capital costs to improve degrading infrastructure. Debt financing is a popular option to raise capital to fund these projects, as revenues from water sales alone are not usually sufficient to finance large projects. This study seeks to understand the current state of water and wastewater debt in North Carolina and quantify future financial capacity for issuing debt. Data on all local government debt issuances from 1951 to 2017 was obtained from the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer Local Government Commission. Analyses find that as of the end of fiscal year 2017, local government utilities in North Carolina have a total of $8.3 billion in outstanding water and wastewater debt. Additional analyses of debt service payments are performed to provide insight into the future capacity of utilities to issue debt. Roian O. Atwood (DEL) Advised by: Deborah Gallagher Examining the Use of Scenario Planning in Corporate Sustainability Strategy Corporate sustainability practitioners utilize a variety of different tools to engage a company's senior leadership and deliver value back to a business organization through reduced risk or cost, improved operational efficiency, or increased revenue generation. Strategy and planning professionals have used scenario planning to predict global oil crises, rebuild post-apartheid South Africa, and advance military maneuvers. This project evaluated the intersection of corporate sustainability and scenario planning through a literature review of core themes, personal interviews with scenario planners and sustainability professionals, and case study research on how companies were able to utilize scenario planning in corporate sustainability. The two case studies pertained to PepsiCo's use of scenarios to build their Performance with Purpose program, and a multi-company collaboration focused on the future of commerce called Retail Horizons. The results demonstrated that there is an opportunity to use scenario planning to better integrate corporate sustainability into business process, set meaningful goals and engage stakeholders by facilitating a trend-based exercise whereby participants are able to explore the uncertainty of future worlds in which their companies must operate. When the conditions are right for scenario planning, corporate sustainability practitioners potentially have an opportunity to use this strategy tool to embed good corporate citizenship while exploring futures where business thrive in tandem with a well-nourished population and sustain global resources.

For this Master's Project, we worked in one of the few remaining patches of untouched forest within the city limits of Durham, North Carolina. We worked with a local nonprofit called the Forest History Society (FHS) to assess how FHS can attain their educational and outreach goals through the creation of a new headquarters site on a 9-acre plot of urban forest in Durham. We conducted three analyses: (1) a forest inventory assessing how vegetation and property characteristics of the site will change over the next 100 years in managed and unmanaged scenarios, (2) a trail feasibility analysis assessing how, where, and with what type of content FHS could build an interpretive trail on the new site, and (3) community outreach assessing how FHS can best connect with the Durham community. Results of the analyses were used to provide recommendations to FHS on management of the property, teaching opportunities, interpretive trail design, and public interface an","Knowledge from ecological sciences is an important reference for landscape design as Urban Green Spaces (UGS) play a critical role in the ecological protection of cities. There is an ongoing debate among ecologists on the value of exotic vegetation to ecosystem resilience and integrity, with authors arguing that in order for ecosystems to survive in future climates, exotic species with similar conditions in their current range must be considered. Others deem biodiversity vital for ecosystem functions and services, stating that most biodiversity losses are man-induced and should be addressed through the enhancement of native communities. Through a literature review, we confronted the arguments used in this debate, with the aim of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the potential of exotic and native vegetation in different aspects of the vegetation’s performance. The outcomes are important for the assessment of vegetation assemblages within UGS projects. Despite the strong arguments regarding their performative and adaptive capacity, we conclude that exotics pose significant ecological risks and have multiple negative impacts on ecosystem processes. Natives not only present high adaptive capacity, but also provide additional benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem integrity, and for people. In a broader framework, the literature demonstrates a preference for the use of native species in most situations.","This study examined the land cover changes in Stubbs Creek, Nigeria using a combination of satellite remote sensing and ground data with the aim of determining the spatial extent and trend of changes of forest landscape in the area using three epochs of satellite imagery (1986, 2000 and 2014) The results indicated that the spatial extent and trend of forest landscape changes within the 28 years period under study (1986 – 2014) showed a decrease of -292.73ha (0.66%) of water bodies with an annual trend of 10.45ha, 11,519.29ha (25.84%) for primary forest with annual trend of 411.40ha and -10,478 (23.50%) hectares for secondary forest with annual trend of 374.21ha, while cultivated lands and Built-up/Bare lands increased by 18,211.79ha (40.86%) and 4,078.23 (9.11%) with an annual trend of 650.48ha and 145.65ha respectively. All land cover changes followed a positive coefficient of correlation. An urgent review of the management of the forest structure in the state, especially around the coastal region is recommended to curtain flooding and erosion. Keyword: Stubbs Creek, Remote sensing, Landuse change, Tropical forest, Biodiversity INTRODUCTION Land is one of the most important natural resources, as life and developmental activities are based on it (Ezeomedo and Igbokwe, 2013). It is becoming a scarce resource due to immense agricultural and demographic pressure. Hence, information on land use/land cover and possibilities for their optimal use becomes pertinent for the selection, planning and implementation of land use schemes to meet the increasing demands for basic human needs and welfare (Ezeomedo and Igbokwe, 2013). Land-use change and land-cover change (LULCC) are terms often used interchangeably but the two have different meanings. Land cover describes the natural and anthropogenic features that can be observed on the Earth's surface (deciduous forests, wetland, developed/built areas, grasslands, water, etc.) and Land use, by contrast, describes activities that take place on the land and represent the current use of property such as residential homes, shopping centers, tree nurseries, state parks, reservoirs, etc. (Jensen, 2005). LULCC, especially those caused by human activities, is one of the most important components of global environmental change (Jensen, 2005). Land use/land cover and human/natural modifications have largely resulted in deforestation, biodiversity loss, global warming and increase of natural disaster-flooding (Reis, 2008). Therefore, available data on LULC changes can provide critical input to decision-making of environmental management and planning the future (Jacob and Olajide, 2011). The growing population and increasing socio-economic necessities creates a pressure on land use/land cover. This pressure results in unplanned and uncontrolled LULC changes. The LULC changes are generally caused by mismanagement of agricultural, urban, range and forest lands which lead to severe environmental problems such as landslides, floods etc. (Reis, 2008). Coastal regions are the most important biodiversity spot and intensely used areas settled by humans in the world (Sesil and Aydinoglu, 2005). In Nigeria, the Niger delta region is an ecological fragile region with high levels of biodiversity and is known to be a repository of biologically diverse plants that offers opportunities for food and pharmaceuticals (NDES, 1997). In addition to providing plants for medicinal purpose, the forest ecosystem also offers products such as fuel wood for cooking, heating, drying/smoking of fish, timber for construction, building industry or boat construction and edible wildlife plants in forms of leafy vegetables, fruits and seeds, spices, food wrappers and starchy tubers (Onojeghuo and Onojeghuo, 2015). Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve located in the Niger delta is believed to contain the largest intact block of forest remaining in Akwa Ibom State (Udo et al., 1997). The reserve is unique because of its composite nature it includes mangrove forest, swamp forest, and lowland rainforest. As a result of population increase, unemployment, oil exploration, etc. and its resulting negative consequences in the area, the unstable and unbalanced development is bringing about destruction to the flora and fauna biodiversity loss. International Journal for Research in Business, Management and Accounting 124 VOL 1 ISSUE 1 December 2015 Paper 8 ISSN : 2455-6114 Several studies have demonstrated the potential of combining satellite remote sensing and ground data (Murdiyarso and Skutsch, 2006) to effectively determine the spatial extent of deforestation across tropical forest regions of the world (DeFries et al., 2005; Ellis and Porter-Bolland, 2008; Onojeghuo and Onojeghuo, 2015). In a study conducted by Ekpeyoung (2015) and Onojeghuo and Onojeghuo (2015), multiple satellite imagery was used to examine the extent of forest cover loss over a period of more two decades in the tropical forests landscape of Akwa Ibom and Cross River States. In order to fill in the existing gap in literature on spatial information of landscape dynamics in the Akwa Ibom State, this paper presents results on the current status of forests in Stubbs Creek with the overall aim to conduct a spatially explicit study of forest cover changes in the area using satellite remote sensing and ground data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Area The Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve (SCFR) covers 310km 2 in southeastern Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria (Ndoho et. al., 2009). It was first created in 1930 under Order 45. This original order has subsequently been amended by Order 16 of 1941, order 17 of 1941, Order 28 of 1941, E.R.L.N 236 of 1955 and E.R.L.N 56 of 1962. Gazetted in 1955 as a forest Reserve, it is probably the only significant forest Reserve in Akwa Ibom State (Ndoho et. al., 2009). Legally, the reserve belongs to the Nigerian Federal Government, but it is managed by Akwa Ibom State. The SCFR lies approximately between latitudes 4 o 32’ N and 4 o 38’N and longitudes 7 o 54’E and 8 o 18’E. It is bounded by Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) installations and Ntak to the West and Unyenge and Okposso communities in the East (Ndoho et. al., 2009). The SCFR is bordered by water on three sides: the Atlantic Ocean on the South, the Kwa Ibo River on the West, and the Cross River estuary on the East (Baker, 2003). The two major creeks, Stubbs and Widenham, run west-east (at about 4 o 36') in the northern half of the reserve (Gadsby, 1989). Mean annual rainfall for this coastal region is high – from 2,000mm to 2,500mm. The mean minimum and maximum temperature are 26 o C and 30.5 o C respectively while the mean relative humidity of the area is about 83% (Werre, 2001). Stubbs Creek is predominantly a freshwater swamp forest that seasonally floods in some zones. It also comprises brackish-water swamp forest, mangrove forest in the eastern end of the reserve, secondary forest, farmland, palm bush, and abandoned farms (Gadsby 1989). In AkwaIbom State, Stubbs Creek represents the only remaining natural coastal swamp forest of any significant size (Tooze et al. 1998a; Tooze et al. 1998b). Remotely Sensed Data The satellite imagery used for the landuse classification and change detection analysis was Landsat Thematic Mapper imageries for three epochs (1986, 2000 and 2014) obtained from the United State Geological Surveys (USGS) with a resolution of 28.5m. These datasets were all acquired in the dry season in order to minimize seasonality variations (Malingreau et al., 1995) and were radiometrically and geometrically corrected to allow for direct image-to-image comparison. Image Classification and Change Detection Analysis The satellite images were classified using the unsupervised ISODATA (Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis) classification technique as described by Ball and Hall (1965) and Onojeghuo and Onojeghuo (2015). This procedure was performed using the ISODATA classifier algorithm in ERDAS Imagine software (ERDAS, 2014). Using independent training and testing data, a total of five broad classes were delineated to show primary forest, secondary forest, cultivated land, built-up/bare land and water bodies. The classified images were also confirmed that they were within tolerance level. The training and validation ground truth data were obtained from Google Earth, high resolution satellite imageries, historic aerial photographs, global positioning system (GPS) ground data and manual interpretation of the satellite imageries used in the study. The process of change detection analysis was performed using the Land Cover Modeler of IDRISI 17.0 Selva Edition. The three time intervals investigated in this study were 1986 to 2000, 2000 to 2014 and 1986 to 2014 respectively. The resulting Areas (in hectares) of land cover types were calculated for each of the study year. The comparison of the land cover statistics assisted in identifying the change in hectares/percentage, trend and rate of change. The percentage change to determine the trend of change was calculated by dividing observed change by sum of changes and multiplied by 100. International Journal for Research in Business, Management and Accounting 125 VOL 1 ISSUE 1 December 2015 Paper 8 ISSN : 2455-6114 (Trend) percentage change = Observed change * 100 (1) Sum of change RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Land Cover Inventory The result in Table 1 and Figure 1, 2 and 3 below indicates that in 1986, water bodies occupied 30,254.40 hectares, primary forest 23,178.33 hectares, secondary forest 22,918.76 hectares, cultivated lands 17,048.03 hectares and built-up/bare lands 5,946.22 hectares. In 2000, water bodies was reduced to 30,122.26 hectares, primary forest area reduced to 22,077.90 hectares, secondary forest reduced to 20463.22 hectares while cultivated lands and built-up lands increased to 19,875.08 hectares and 6807.27 hectares respectively (Figure 2). In 2014, water bodies and primary forest were reduced to 29,961.67 hectares and 11","The crisis of ecosystem deterioration caused by climate change has become a predominant global issue. In urban environments, the role of development is often taken as the single most important element in this deterioration. However, the green movement includes a variety of multilateral approaches including simply planting where possible, building utilizing sustainable environments, creating biodiversity, and inventing new technologies. With them, we need to make strenuous efforts to overturn the current apartment housing concepts from a `dry as chip` housing culture to a green-friendly environment. Thus farming gardens could be an important contributing measure to make green environments within the apartment buildings and complexes. The aim of this study is to present an apartment floor plan with farming garden in order to make the approach realistic and effective in creating a community which enhances the health of residents. Research method used is an analysis of the literature review regarding building's green infrastructure, and the role and potentiality of urban farming. In addition, this study presents analysis of previous research review, academic books, statistics, and speakers' presentation from recent relevant conferences. Findings confirm that green infrastructure and urban farming give life to a desolate apartment's culture in Korea and is effective in dealing with the ecosystem's deterioration and green cultural spin-off spreading it into residents' community. The uniqueness of this study lies in referring to farming garden built in apartment buildings in earnest and ensuring innovation to maintain the holistic health of residents in community.","Freshwater ecosystems are susceptible to biodiversity losses due to land conversion. This is particularly true for the conversion of land from forests for agriculture and urban development. Freshwater sediments harbor microorganisms that provide vital ecosystem services. In dynamic habitats like freshwater sediments, microbial communities can be shaped by many processes, although the relative contributions of environmental factors to microbial community dynamics remain unclear. Given the future projected increase in land use change, it is important to ascertain how associated changes in stream physico-chemistry will influence sediment microbiomes. Here, we characterized stream chemistry and sediment bacterial community composition along a mixed land-use gradient in West Virginia, USA across one growing season. Sediment bacterial community richness was unaffected by increasing anthropogenic land use, though microbial communities were compositionally distinct across sites. Community threshold analysis revealed greater community resilience to agricultural land use than urban land use. Further, predicted metagenomes suggest differences in potential microbial function across changes in land use. The results of this study suggest that low levels of urban land use change can alter sediment bacterial community composition and predicted functional capacity in a mixed-use watershed, which could impact stream ecosystem services in the face of global land use change.","In human-dominated environments, efforts to preserve ecological connectivity between animal species habitats is an important issue. These areas are indeed concern by anthropogenic pressures leading to rapid land use and land cover changes (LUCC). This is particularly the case of urban fringes, affected by many changes (e.g. urban sprawl) specifically for several decades. \n \n \nOf all the methods to model the ecological networks connectivity, landscape graphs provide a relevant approach, which interest for decision support in land-use planning has already been highlighted (Foltete et al., 2014). This approach allows to represent ecological networks in a simplified way as graphs composed of nodes (species habitat patches) and links representing potential connections between these nodes according to species movement capacities. From this simplified representation, it is possible to measure the degree of networks functional connectivity from spatial metrics, among which the PC index (Saura et al., 2011) used to characterize long-distance connectivity with regard to the overall network. Analyses are typically conducted at one spatial scale. However, including multiple scales may be necessary to model ecological networks. \n \n \nWe introduce a methodology based on landscape graphs in a multi-scale approach to measure ecological impact of LUCC in a context of urban fringes. Two input data are required, (1) a multi-date high-resolution cartography of land-use, and (2) information about life traits (habitat and movement comportments) of several species representing biodiversity. From these inputs, ecological network modelling integrates a multi-scale approach by the construction of metapatches (Zetterberg et al. 2010). Decomposing iteratively LUCC by transition type, the core of the analysis consists to compute in each case the variation of the PC index. We discuss how this methodology allows to synthesize ecological impact of LUCC and have potential application in land-use planning.","Globally, natural resources are declining due primarily to unsustainable human consumption. Resource scarcity and associated problems therefore arise fundamentally from social processes. This thesis compares and contrasts the relative merit of the three dominant environmental sociology perspectives for their respective ability to explain the effect of human societies on natural resources. First is the perspective of population pressure driving resource scarcity; a perspective commonly known, and referred to herein, as 'Malthusian overpopulation'. Second is the perspective of free market capitalism and associated market expansion driving resource scarcity; a perspective commonly cited as the 'treadmill of production' in environmental sociology (herein referred to as 'market expansion'). Third is the perspective of modernization driving resource scarcity at low levels of modernization and resource abundance at high levels of modernization; a perspective commonly known as 'ecological modernization' in environmental sociology and the 'environmental Kuznets curve' in ecological economics (herein referred to as 'modernization'). Each perspective is supported by many scholars, and has a significant literature to substantiate the respective claims of the key social processes that cause change in the state of natural resource. Critical comparison of the three perspectives will likely offer greater insight into interactions between societies and natural resources than examining one perspective alone, and may therefore offer more appropriate solutions to the challenges posed by resource scarcity. \n \nThere are gaps in our understanding of society's effects on natural resources that are apparent from a review of comparative studies on the three dominant perspectives. First, most studies that compare and contrast the relative merit of the three perspectives correlate proxy variables for each of the perspectives [e.g. human population density (for 'Malthusian overpopulation'), and Gross Domestic Product (for 'market expansion')] with environmental indicators (e.g. fishery biomass) without explicitly considering mechanisms such as resource exploitation intensity or resource management institution efficacy. Second, few of the comparative analyses that have been undertaken to date, explicitly compare and contrast the three perspectives at the local-level. Most studies have instead focused on the national-level. Yet interactions between societies and resources vary significantly across social-political levels, and one could argue that most decisions to exploit and manage resources do occur at the local level, particularly in less affluent societies where there is comparatively limited centralised management and vast reserves of natural resources. Third, there is inadequate attention paid to the developing country context. Most studies that compare the perspectives are either global or focused on affluent nations. Few studies have focused analyses on poorer, economically peripheral nations where much of the world's biodiversity and other natural resources exist. This is critical for two reasons; first, affluent and poor societies represent very different social contexts so conclusions drawn from global or affluent-nation analyses are unlikely to be transferrable to developing countries; second world systems theory suggests that affluent societies import resources and export pollutants to poorer societies and vice-versa, and therefore opportunities to modernize as per the modernization perspective might be difficult to realize. Fourth, no comparative analyses of the perspectives have included research on local perceptions of society's effects on natural resources. Understanding local perceptions, however, is useful to confirm (or refute) hypothesis-driven research and potentially useful to increase the likelihood of implementation of research recommendations in applied research. \n \nThe aim of this thesis is to fill these research gaps by 1) explaining society's effects on natural resources, at the local-level in an economically peripheral nation, using dominant environmental sociology perspectives (research gaps 1-3), and to 2) determine whether local perceptions, support or refute the scientific explanation (research gap 4). These broad aims are achieved by completing the following research objectives: \n \n1. Determine which dominant environmental sociology perspectives, of societies effects on natural resources, best explains the effects of exploitation on; \n \n a) Coral reef fish that are vulnerable to extinction by overfishing; \n \n b) Function and diversity of coral reef fish; \n \n2. Determine which of the perspectives explain the occurrence of coral reef resource management institutions; and \n \n3. Determine whether local perceptions support, or refute, the findings, as identified in objectives 1 and 2, of society's effects on the exploitation and management of coral reef fish. \n \nTo achieve research objective 1, I collected secondary social (census) and ecological (survey) data from 25 local-level sites spanning Solomon Islands. I then analysed the data using structural equation models to explain how proxy variables, which represent each of the dominant perspectives, affect fishing pressure to, in turn, affect the distributions of a) biomass of coral reef fish that are vulnerable to overfishing and b) coral reef fish functional group biomass and diversity. The key aspects of fish distributions I examined were explained by fishing pressure. Specifically, there was lower biomass of coral reef fish that are vulnerable to overfishing, lower biomass of key functional groups of fishes, and lower fish species diversity where there was higher fishing pressure. The key finding, which addresses research objective 1 is that fishing pressure was, in turn, driven by high human population density and greater access to markets; proxy variables for the Malthusian overpopulation and market expansion perspectives, respectively. Modernization had no discernable effect on fishing pressure. \n \nTo achieve research objective 2, I collected data for proxy variables of each of the dominant perspectives and on coral reef resource management institutions (gear restrictions, species restrictions, and spatial closures) from ≥723 local-level sites spanning Solomon Islands (I developed some of the survey instrument on management institutions but the data were collected by the national government and other agencies). I then tested the effects of each set of proxy variables, which represent each of the perspectives, on the occurrence of management institutions using a range of statistical analyses. I found that the presence of management institutions was negatively correlated with human population density and positively correlated with modernization and the presence of fish markets, lending support to the Malthusian overpopulation perspective, and simultaneously detracting from the market expansion perspective. The results neither clearly supported nor refuted the modernization perspective. \n \nTo achieve research objective 3, I conducted interviews, using a survey instrument, with 119 fishers and fish traders in the major urban centres of Solomon Islands to identify which factors they perceive can increase and decrease coral reef fish stocks. The qualitative responses were coded, and analysed using Principal Components Analysis to derive the dominant perceptions. The interviewed fishers and middlemen perceived an extensive range of factors to be causing fish decline, and also stated a diverse range of management interventions that they perceived would increase fish stocks. Respondents identified fishing as a major cause of fish decline driven by income-related needs, among other factors, which is concordant with the findings of objectives 1 and 2. \n \nIn this thesis I compared the three dominant perspectives of society's effects on natural resources using a novel model in an economically peripheral nation at the local-level. In doing so, I found greatest support for both the Malthusian overpopulation and market expansion perspectives. This finding was concordant with local perceptions, adding further weight of evidence. Given these findings, it can be expected that, with predicted population growth and continued resource commoditization and aspirations of affluence, coral reef resources will likely continue to be depleted in Solomon Islands, and other locations with comparable context (economically peripheral). Policy prescriptions that aim to slow this depletion must consider local population pressure and markets as dominant driving forces.","Climate change is a dominant reality of our time, a series of physical changes to earth’s systems that will impact human wellbeing, social stability, biodiversity, and the familiar patterns of harvest and storms on God’s green earth.  The Fifth Assessment Report clearly states that climate change is already having an impact on our planet and will worsen the lot of the poor in particular.  A critical link between this scientific assessment of the state of the planet and Christian faith is thereby found in the gospel invitation to care for the poor.  Yet arguably many Christians have not internalized this reality, and the central symbols of Christian faith are not yet consciously intertwined with the reality of climate change in the ways needed to summon strong action.  Therefore, the critical question addressed here is how ministers can help lead their communities to understand the links between climate change and faith -- and then inspire them to act. My focus group research among over 135 faith-based environmentalists show that the motivation for environmental advocacy is effectively created through group discussion in the kinds of trusted groups that congregations and faith communities exemplify.  Congregations and faith communities are privileged places for engaging potential environmental leaders, and for supporting the work of already active environmentalists. Research Objectives: Empirical research was conducted while a fellow of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.  The objective was to engage environmental decision theory as well as theological analysis to understand the factors that motivate faith-based environmentalists. Methods: Participants were chosen from mainstream congregational sustainability committees.  The Christian groups included Baptists (WA), three groups of Catholics (suburban NJ, urban NY, rural WA), two groups of Episcopalians (suburban and urban NJ), megachurch Christian Evangelicals (FL), Reformed Christians (NJ), two groups of Presbyterians/ PCUSA (MD), Unitarian-Universalists (NJ), and southern pastors (NC). Participant statements provided the primary starting point for analysis. I asked questions about congregational activity, personal motivations, how beliefs developed, and behavior change, and employed semi-structured questions to permit systematic comparison and analysis.  Discussions were transcribed and coded both inductively and deductively using NVivo 8 content analysis software (QSR Software, Melbourne) to compare and rank the responses. This essay represents analysis of a small portion of the data collected and the conclusions drawn from it.","Cities have moved to the forefront of global socio-economic change, with half of the world’s population now living in urban areas and the other half increasingly dependent upon cities for their economic, social and political progress. Factors such as globalisation and democratisation have increased the importance of cities for sustainable development. Water is a driving force for sustainable development, vital to all living organisms and ecosystems and essential to human health, food production and social and economic development. Political commitment, education, and community action will be key to more sustainable patterns of water conservation and use. The almost contiguous lakes of Tulsi, Vihar and Powai and their immediate surroundings constitute the study area. This region, which is about 50 sq. km. in area, serves as the vital lungs of suburban Mumbai. It comprises a rich natural landscape bestowed with sweeping valleys, dense vegetation and an interweaving of streams and rivers evolving into an ecosystem of significant value to the city. The study area is in fact the last link to a larger ecosystem of fresh water lakes of the city. The lakes and their peripheries are under severe threat due to the rapid and haphazard development aided by the relaxation of developmental restrictions in no-development zones, increasing population density and environmentally detrimental land uses. Conservation of natural values is usually a function first disrupted by the intensification of human land use. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that social attitudes towards nature are marked by ignorance, negligence and often downright callousness. The result is that despite nature’s many warnings, the pollution and destruction of the natural environment continues intensively and extensively. Nature can be considered as an interactive process, responsive to laws, constituting a value system, and offering both intrinsically variable opportunities and limitations to human uses. Present land use regulations neither recognize natural processes, nor allocate responsibility to the developer. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects, today reduced to the simplest terms like height, volume, density, alignment, etc. along with a thorough cost benefit analysis, needs to urgently incorporate resource values, social values and aesthetic values based on natural processes. Evaluating environmental losses and gains is one important aspect of planning that is increasingly in need of further elaboration. Many of the problems of the natural environment that challenge human society today have to be looked at from a wider perspective than just their immediate situation, for almost all are rooted in the larger eco-system and biodiversity of their region. There is an urgent demand for an informed and longsighted management of the natural environment and resources, and a need for concerted efforts to radically improve pertinent knowledge, methods and techniques. The science of ecology is broadly defined as the interaction of elements of the landscape. There has been considerable progress in this field in the past decades, all of which should be a valuable aid to the planning of development. A plan purely based on economics is more than likely to undermine a balance between natural principles and manmade interventions. The problem to be addressed in developing a strategy for biodiversity conservation is that current institutions in society, including markets do not respond to environmental feedbacks. That is many of the most important environmental factors are not recognised in the set of market prices. They are external to the market. The implications of this, is that individual users of biological resources will not take the true cost of their actions into account. Indeed the failure of the markets can be seen as the prime driving force behind the loss of biodiversity. To do this it is necessary to identify the major social and economic forces that are currently driving the loss of functional diversity and to create incentives to redirect those forces. Forces which result in direct reduction of biodiversity because of land use changes, landscape fragmentation. And also those forces which include inappropriate government policies, the structure of property rights, pressures of human population growth and poverty ,and values of society. At the same time it is necessary to create economic incentives that reduce the difference between the value of biological diversity to the private individual and its value to society as a whole.So as to motivate the conservation of biodiversity. The recently published works of Ian Mcharg, Lars Nyberg, William Honachefsky, Lyle and Roy Winter continue to demonstrate that there is considerable wisdom in planning our landuse around the ecological constraints of the land. Problems of modern landscape management also ask for an ecological resource approach, planning for flows of energy, water nutrients and materials as an integrated part of land use and physical planning1. At the same time it is essential for the development of effective institutions for biodiversity conservation. Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction .They structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic and shape the way societies evolve through time. Institutions provide the framework for human actions but to be effective they have to be adaptive. That is it is necessary to frame the level of economic activity in a way that minimises the risk of irreversible damage to the systems on which human activity depends. This means that science’s most effective contributions to sustainable consumption conundrum are likely to come not only from technical and natural science laboratories but also from practical insights of pedagogy, social psychology, and systems thinking. Vocabulary of the conservation professionals needs to be transformed. Through the study of the lake region a critical review of the existing legal provisions for the environmental protection and conservation and the development control regulations is undertaken too. The paper discusses shortcomings and limitations of the Development Control Rules (DCR) that have made it easy for developers to ignore environmental concerns while not actually violating the law, which in turn has caused catastrophic damage to the lake ecology. The present approaches to land use planning primarily through zoning ordinances and subdivision regulations have led to a lot of shortcomings and our failure to address these short comings which have been the major causes of the detrimental effects on the environment. The policy framework in place needs to be addressed. The study therefore seeks to rectify those omissions, in particular it argues the need for social equity to be seen as an integral component of policies for achieving sustainability and it recommends a new kind of environmental planning that would incorporate such issues as waste management, pollution ,environmental conservation into the development and land use planning processes at all levels and also conscious ,informed engagement of the community in the conservation initiative. The concept of environmental planning developed in this paper is natural evolution of a more comprehensive and strategic approach to environmental management. In other words, our inability to deal with ecological limits is not determined by insufficient understanding of natural sciences of natural science of sustainability .Solid analysis and documentation of the challenges is undoubtedly a necessary condition for meaningful action. However, the principal stumbling block for dealing creatively, effectively and humanely with limits are shaped by significant socio-psychological characteristics of our dominant culture. These perceptual stumbling blocks require more attention if we are to learn to live in ways that are compatible with Natures limited capacity to regenerate itself. Physiographic determinism was employed as a tool to evaluate the extent of the negative impact on the environment, by superimposing the various physiographic features on the land use plans and simultaneously extracting and de-layering to establish the intrinsic suitability of land for various land uses. The study deals with various issues of ecology on one hand and developmental issues on the other. Extensive use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) is made for the analysis and information envisioning like producing an ecological base map of the area. The study has established the baseline conditions for conserving the environmental aspects and has further identified mitigation measures, which can be incorporated into the scheme to reduce the adverse impact on the lake ecology. The study recommends a provision of a legislative framework for the conservation initiative to continue and in the long run for the sustainability of the project. 1 Tjillanji, Landscape Ecology of a Stressed Environment, ed. by Claire C vos and Paul","Lobley and Winters’ introductory chapter is followed by chapters covering a wide range of topics that fit within the following broad themes. Part 1 – New Uses of Land: (2) Strategic land use for ecosystem services (Lowe et al.); (3) Perennial energy crops (Karp et al.); (4) Soaking up the carbon (Smith); (5) Anaerobic digestion (Banks et al.); (6) The management of lowland floodplains (Morris et al.); and (7) Ecosystem services (Hubacek et al.). Part 2 – Emerging Issues: (8) Adaptation of biodiversity to climate change (Hopkins); (9) Public engagement in new productivism (Ravenscroft and Taylor); (10) Landscape creation (Firbank et al.); (11) Agricultural stewardship (Potter); (12) Regulating land use technologies (Dunlop); and (13) Ethical approaches to land-use decision making (Carruthers). Henceforward in this review chapters will be referred to by these numbers. Food security is reviewed in these proceedings. For example, the political move from global trade and accepted food insecurity in the UK to the emphasis on domestic production (2, 6), while a wider EU perspective is given by Potter (11). The emergence of a new form of productivism is well reviewed by Ravenscroft and Taylor (9), who conclude that ‘. . . the newly emergent food citizenship that leads people to invest time, money and emotion into farming [challenges] the consumer citizenship that formerly undermined the production focus of many of the small farms . . .’ (my italics) (p. 229). This concept is not new (e.g. see Lang et al., 2009, already reviewed in this Journal), but it is a useful reminder of the need for people to take more control of their food. And it is no surprise that the majority of such projects has so far been ‘. . . the preserve of those with sufficient cultural and economic capital to ‘afford’ this form of civil labour’ (9, p. 226). In other words (although not stated here), there is a paucity of such projects in poorer, and often urban, parts of Britain. The concept of a mutifunctional countryside is extremely well covered in these proceedings (2, 9, 11 and 12). As the editors state: ‘A multifunctional countryside . . . encompasses, in particular, recreational, nature conservation and landscape interests’ (p. 6). As Lowe et al. (2) state: ‘Applied systems ecology . . . must meet up with economic and institutional analysis of the governance of land and natural resources if we are to establish clear principles and procedures for making sustainable trade-offs between desired ecosystem services’ (p. 35). I am always impressed by the ‘can do’ approach and was therefore pleased to read some useful policy options for Government, reviewed by Dunlop (12). Issues covered here ranged across: defining target risks, setting targets, carbon pricing/trading, subsidies for land diversification, R&amp;D grants, and epistemic social and institutional learning. Local trends constitute the third key focus of these proceedings, or as stated in introductory chapter (1), ‘A growing sense of place pervades agricultural and food policy discourse’ (p. 7). Apart from local food citizenship issues already reviewed above, energy provision is also vital. The chapter on anaerobic digestion (AD), by Banks et al., (5) is therefore helpful, although the authors conclude that: ‘. . . There is . . . an urgent need to evaluate fully the role that biogas [energy] can play in rural development . . . [and] there is still a need for research and support for the development and introduction of low-cost","This thesis explores the economics of the most recent rush for land in \nhuman history, with a series of different but intertwined essays. The surge \nin Large-Scale Land Acquisitions (LSLAs) observed in the last two decades \nexpresses elements of discontinuity and novelty compared to other land \nrushes that occurred in the past. First, despite the existence of a domestic \ncomponent in many of these land deals, the transnational nature of the \nLSLAs phenomenon is predominant. Second, notwithstanding the \ninvolvement of public actors at various levels, the demand for land behind \nLSLAs has a strong private component, suggesting that a new international \nmarket for land — with both new and traditional players — is in the \nmaking. Third, the demand in this market reflects the multiple and \ncompeting uses of land in the contemporary world: from agriculture and \nmining to biofuel and energy production; but also from urban development \nto conservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. \nThe Introduction dissects the approximately 120 million hectares (ha) of \nland that were demanded through LSLAs since the beginning of the new \nmillennium. The chapter analyses the geographical distribution of LSLAs; \nit scrutinises the different stakeholders typically involved; it reviews the \nmain purposes of the investments behind these land deals, as well as their \nimplementation and negotiation status; and it contextualises these data and \nfigures with regards to the existing literature, providing a general but \ndetailed overview of the main trends, drivers, and implications of LSLAs. \nIn this sense, this chapter paves the way for the following three essays. \nIndeed, despite a narrative that is constantly imbued with words and \nconcepts — such as land deals, investments or acquisitions — borrowed from \nto the economic jargon, the economics of LSLAs still remains a largely \nunexplored field, both from a theoretical and from an empirical perspective. \nChapter I challenges the current lack of a systematic economic theory for \nLSLAs by providing the foundations for a new conceptualisation of land in \neconomics. If the basis for this chapter is rooted in the past and retraces a \nbrief — and necessarily incomplete — history of land in the economic \nthought, the essence of it rests very much on the novelties and peculiarities \nof the current LSLAs phenomenon. Understanding the many faces of land \nin economics in the context of transnational land deals proved to be a nontrivial \nexercise. Nevertheless, this chapter provides a clear and simple \nframework to disentangle the multiple — and sometimes conflicting — \nvalues that are attached to land in the 21st century, thus helping us to \nunderstand how and why different actors are trading large portions of land \nacross and within national borders. \nChapter II brings a more empirical perspective into the analysis. The \nliterature on LSLAs is polarised across two opposite positions: The \n(relatively favourable) opinion of the advocates of LSLAs as a development \nopportunity clashes with the (relatively unfavourable) view of those who \nbelieve that this phenomenon is land grabbing perpetrated by unscrupulous \ninvestors and complaisant institutions over the head of local populations. \nUsing data from the Land Matrix, I drew a line between speculative landbased \ninvestments and productive ones, postulating that it is only when the \noperations start that it becomes possible to evaluate the actual distribution \nof costs and benefits among the various stakeholders. \nWith different probit and logit model specifications, I estimated the \nmarginal effects and the level of significance of different factors that are \neither hindering or bolstering the operationalisation of investments \nrequiring LSLAs. Results from a broad sample of over 2,000 large-scale land \ndeals suggest that deal-specific features — such as the intention of the \ninvestment and the size of the deal — influence the actual implementation \nof these investments. The institutions of both origin and destination countries affect the implementation of LSLAs, but in ways that are not \nalways straightforward to interpret. Overall, the combined analysis of dealspecific \nand institutional variables suggests that a more efficient mix of \nregulations and policies in both destination and investor countries — \npossibly with fewer rules, but clearer, more enforceable and diversified \nupon different investment types — can improve the chances of actual \nimplementation of LSLAs, therefore enhancing the development potential \nembedded in some of these deals, and at the same time reducing the risks \nassociated with land grabbing and predatory investments. \nChapter III explores the issue of fair compensation in LSLAs. The \noverlap between formal and informal tenure regimes in many destination \ncountries often results in LSLAs leading to forced evictions of local \ncommunities, land disputes and land conflicts. In this context, the right to \nfair compensation and the principle of Free Prior and Informed Consent \n(FPIC), are often seen as the solution to these problems. Yet, the existing \nevidence suggests that — even when customary tenure regimes are \nformally recognised and customary right owners are entitled to fair \ncompensation — little compensation, if any, is awarded to indigenous \npeople and local communities affected by LSLAs, often leaving space for \nsocial unrest and generalised discontent. After revisiting the foundation of \nthe economics of fair compensation and tailoring the analysis around the \npeculiarities of LSLAs, Chapter III presents — and solves by backward \ninduction — an original three-player sequential game for fair compensation \nin transnational land deals, providing insights on how and why the fair \ncompensation principle can fail. Notably, the assumption of full and \nsymmetric information among the three players — namely the investor, the \nlocal government and the local community — does not prevent the game \nfrom ending with a land dispute, an outcome modelled as leading to \nadditional costs for all players. \nThe final chapter distils the main findings and connects the dots \nbetween the previous chapters, by critically reviewing all the implications \nof LSLAs that emerged during this study and by outlining the overall \ncontribution of this research.","Preface The 3rd International Conference Environment and Sustainable Development of Territories: Ecological Challenges of the 21st Century was successfully held in Kazan, Russia 27–29 September 2017. Currently, there are significant changes in the environment: the depletion of the planet’s resources, environmental pollution, reduced biodiversity and frequent natural and man-made disasters which are bringing huge damage to the natural and socio-economic systems. All these problems resonate especially in 2017 – announced in Russia as the “Year of Environmental Protection”. Under consideration during the conference were the fundamental basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the environmental components, the interdisciplinary aspects of the strategy for human survival and the development of scientific bases and technologies for the control and regulation of the quality of the environment and environmental technologies. The conference was attended by over 300 researchers from different countries, who discussed the results of their work within the framework of six main areas: Global Pollution, Environmental Impact Management, Ecological Risks and Sustainable Development; Geoecology and Exodynamic Processes; Climate Change, Macrocirculation Processes and the Ecology of Atmosphere; Strategies for Biological Resource Protection and Optimization; Mathematical Methods and GIS Technologies in Ecology and Management of Natural Resources; Soil and Land Resources, their Conservation and Efficient Management, and Food Safety; Social, Economic and Ecological Aspects of Urban Territory Development Analysis and Management. The Conference became the platform for the coordination of efforts and developments in the area of environmental study, revealing the strategic areas of research, the ways of communication with state authorities and organizations who are working in the real economy. More than 400 papers were submitted from universities and research institutes to the “Environment and Sustainable Development of Territories: Ecological Challenges of the 21st Century” Conference. All of the papers were subjected to peer-review by conference Programme Committee members and international reviewers. This proceeding included papers which fall within the scope of the IOP Conference Series on Earth and Environmental Sciences. The papers were selected on the basis of their originality and relevancy to the conference. On behalf of the organizers we would like to thank all the authors who have contributed to our conference, reviewers, chairpersons and sponsors. We believe that the next conference will attract the attention of more and more researchers and become a significant event for our colleagues all over the world. Professor Svetlana Selivanovskaya Kazan Federal University, Russia","Can Gio mangrove forest (CGM) is located downstream of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), situated between an estuarine system of Dong Nai - Sai Gon river and a part of Vam Co river. The CGM is the largest restored mangrove forest in Vietnam and the UNESCO’s Mangrove Biosphere Reserve. The CGM has been gradually facing to numeric challenges of global climate change, environmental degradation and socio-economic development for the last decades. To evaluate sediment quality in the CGM, we collected 13 cores to analyze for sediment grain size, organic matter content, and trace element concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn. Results showed that trace element concentrations ranged from uncontaminated (Cd, Cu, and Zn) to very minor contaminated (Cr, Ni, and Pb). The concentrations were gradually influenced by suspended particle size and the mangrove plants.ReferencesAnh M.T., Chi D.H., Vinh N.N., Loan T.T., Triet L.M., Slootenb K.B.-V., Tarradellas J., 2003.

The SPA is composed of over 200 preeminent scientists and researchers from the eight Amazonian countries, French Guiana, and global partners. These experts came together to debate, analyze, and assemble the accumulated knowledge of the scientific community, Indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders that live and work in the Amazon. The Panel is inspired by the Leticia Pact for the Amazon. This is a first-of-its-kind Report which provides a comprehensive, objective, open, transparent, systematic, and rigorous scienti fic assessment of the state of the Amazon’s ecosystems, current trends, and their implications for the long-term well-being of the region, as well as opportunities and policy relevant options for conservation and sustainable development. threats to land rights and climate change. Expanding clandestine economies of multiple types threaten protected areas and spur forest degradation, especially IPLCs, whose lands may not be adequately demarcated, legally recognized, and protected by the government. processes consequences for and precarious urbanization, and other On the other hand, local livelihoods based on longstanding and diversified agroforestry and fisheries systems, that bridge rural and urban networks, remain vulnerable and largely unrecognized in regional public policies. One of the main opportunities to reconcile food production, inclusive economies, and nature conservation in the Amazon is to support the thousands of place-based initiatives promoting more sustainable and diversified agriculture and resource use practices. Throughout the region, these initiatives are providing multiple of employment, regional development, and Abstract Finding pathways to more sustainable agriculture and resource use remains the most pressing challenge for Amazonian countries today. This chapter focuses on characterizing recent changes in the structure and types of agrarian production systems, including fisheries. The chapter identifies local responses to deal with both the challenges and opportunities to promote more sustainable production and extraction economies in the Amazon. While regional agriculture and resource economies rest on a rich diversity of producers, knowledge, and production systems, the expansion of agribusiness enterprises came to dom-inate the distribution of subsidies, institutional support, and logistical infrastructure. These trends are associated with forest loss and degradation, pollution of waterways, pressures on and/or displacement of Indigenous and rural communities, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, all of which undermine an array of ecosystem services. The impacts of socio-economic and hydro-climatic changes on livelihoods, environments and biodiversity are very diverse and complex in each one of the Amazonian countries and within them. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth quantitative case study focusing on the Brazilian Amazon, including attention to changes in key agrarian production systems (agricultural crops, cattle raising, agroforestry, and tree plantations). The chapter uses comparable agrarian census data from 1995, 2006, and 2017. The quantitative analysis is complemented by qualitative and empirically grounded discussions that provide insights into the changes and impacts of different activities, how they are interlinked, and how they differ across Amazonian countries. The final section provides recommendations towards promoting adaptive, profitable, and more sustainable smallholder production and management systems that reduce deforestation and support local communities and economies, in the context of increasing urbanization and climate change.","Quantitative information on the general locations and amounts of undiscovered porphyry copper resources of the world is important to exploration managers, land-use and environmental planners, economists, and policymakers. This publication contains the results of probabilistic estimates of the amounts of copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) in undiscovered porphyry copper deposits in the Andes Mountains of South America. The methodology used to make these estimates is called the \"Three-Part Form.” It was developed to explicitly express estimates of undiscovered resources and associated uncertainty in a form that allows economic analysis and is useful to decisionmakers. The three-part form of assessment includes: (1) delineation of tracts of land where the geology is permissive for porphyry copper deposits to form; (2) selection of grade and tonnage models appropriate for estimating grades and tonnages of the undiscovered porphyry copper deposits in each tract; and (3) estimation of the number of undiscovered porphyry copper deposits in each tract consistent with the grade and tonnage model. A Monte Carlo simulation computer program (EMINERS) was used to combine the probability distributions of the estimated number of undiscovered deposits, the grades, and the tonnages of the selected model to obtain the probability distributions for undiscovered metals in each tract. These distributions of grades and tonnages then can be used to conduct economic evaluations of undiscovered resources in a format usable by decisionmakers. Economic evaluations are not part of this report. The results of this assessment are presented in two principal parts. The first part identifies 26 regional tracts of land where the geology is permissive for the occurrence of undiscovered porphyry copper deposits of Phanerozoic age to a depth of 1 km below the Earth’s surface. These tracts are believed to contain most of South America's undiscovered resources of copper. The second part presents probabilistic estimates of the amounts of copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver in undiscovered porphyry copper deposits in each tract. The study also provides tables showing the location, tract number, and age (if available) of discovered deposits and prospects. For each of the 26 permissive tracts delineated in this study, summary information is provided on: (1) the rationale for delineating the tract; (2) the rational for choosing the mineral deposit model used to assess the tract; (3) discovered deposits and prospects; (4) 2 Quantitative Mineral Resource Assessment of Copper, Molybdenum, Gold, and Silver in Undiscovered Porphyry Copper Deposits in the Andes Mountains of South America: USGS Open-File Report 2008-1253 exploration history; and (5) the distribution of undiscovered deposits in the tract. The scale used to evaluate geologic information and draw tracts is 1:1,000,000. There are 69 known porphyry copper deposits in the Andes using criteria adopted herein to define a deposit. This assessment estimates that about 145 undiscovered deposits remain. In other words, about twice as many new deposits might be found as have already been found. Not only have large quantities of copper been discovered, but also even larger quantities of undiscovered copper remain. About 590 million metric tons of copper have been discovered. About 190 million tons of this amount are in 57 deposits of the general porphyry copper type whereas nearly 400 million metric tons are in an additional 12 giant deposits. This study estimates that there are approximately 750 million metric tons of copper in undiscovered deposits of these two types in the Andes. This undiscovered copper resource is the sum of the mean estimated copper in each of 26 tracts. About 470 million metric tons of this copper are estimated to occur in 137 undiscovered deposits in 24 tracts of the general porphyry copper type, plus another 280 million metric tons estimated in 8 undiscovered deposits in 2 tracts of the giant porphyry copper type. The total discovered, mined, and undiscovered copper amounts to an endowment, or grand total, of about 1.3 billion metric tons. The estimates suggest there may be almost 1.3 times as much copper to be found in porphyry copper deposits of the Andes as has already been found. In addition to copper, the undiscovered deposits also contain large estimated amounts of molybdenum (20,000,000 metric tons), gold (13,000 tons), and silver (250,000 tons). The estimated undiscovered copper is equivalent to about 80 percent of the world reserve base; molybdenum, 105 percent; gold, 14 percent; and silver, 44 percent. Not all of these undiscovered mineral resources are likely to be available for discovery and development. Commonly, a significant amount of land delineated as permissive or even favorable for the occurrence of undiscovered mineral deposits is not available for mineral exploration, discovery, and development because it consists of urban areas, transportation corridors, forest and wildlife preserves, sensitive ecosystems, protected biodiversity areas, sensitive and threatened surface and groundwater supplies, wilderness areas, national parks, private land where mining is not desired, and many other reasons. Global inventory and analysis are needed of such restrictions and their probable impact on future mineral supply and costs. The porphyry copper resources reported herein are not evenly distributed throughout the Andes region. The Chuquicamata tract (SA10a,bPC) and the El Teniente tract (SA14bPC) are remarkable in containing exceptionally large deposits of discovered, mined, and estimated undiscovered copper that do not conform to grade and tonnage characteristics of the general porphyry copper model appropriate for other Andean tracts. The deposits in these two tracts being significantly larger in tonnage and higher in grade necessitated a new giant model that is more representative of their characteristics. The greatest premining endowment of copper is in Eocene-Oligocene tract SA10a,bPC with about 460 million metric tons, followed by late Miocene-early Pliocene tract SA14bPC with about 220 million metric tons. The next largest endowments are in tract SA8PC (a Paleocene–Eocene tract of Chile-southern Peru) containing an endowment of about 98 million metric tons and in tract SA6PC (the middle–late Miocene tract of PeruEcuador) with an endowment of about 96 million metric tons. The undiscovered copper remaining to be found in these four tracts is estimated to be: tract SA10a,bPC, 210 million metric tons; tract SA14bPC, 69 million; tract SA6PC, 49 million; and tract SA8PC, 43 million. Density of estimated undiscovered metal in tracts was examined as mean metric tons of metal per km in undiscovered deposits. Giant tracts SA10a,bPC and SA14bPC have the highest copper densities with about 8,200 and 7,400 metric tons per km, respectively. The next richest tracts, with just over 2,000 metric tons per km, are tracts SA12PC and SA14dPC. About 90 percent of the total discovered and estimated undiscovered copper resources in Andean porphyry copper deposits is of Cenozoic age; the remainder is Cretaceous (4%), Jurassic (5%), and Permian (2%) in age. The Cenozoic resources are in tracts with host rock ages of Eocene–Oligocene 3 Prepared and published jointly by the geological surveys of Argentina (SEGEMAR), Chile (SERNAGEOMIN), Colombia, (INGEOMINAS), Peru (INGEMMET), and the United States (USGS) (39%), Miocene–Pliocene (29%), Paleocene–Eocene (12%), and Miocene (11%). The Eocene–Oligocene and Miocene–Pliocene tracts are dominated by giant tracts SA10a,bPC (includes Chuquicamata deposit) and SA14bPC (includes El Teniente deposit). There appear to have been three approximately 16-million-year-long episodes of porphyry copper deposit formation in the Andes during Cenozoic time: Paleocene–early Eocene, late Eocene–early Oligocene; and middle Miocene–early Pliocene. These three episodes appear to be separated by two intervening quiescent periods of 5 to 9 million years duration in the middle Eocene (44-49 Ma) and late Oligocene–early Miocene (20-29 Ma). These two periods correspond to times of change in Pacific plate boundaries, geometries, and directions and rates of spreading and convergence. There are variations in the geographic trends of magmatic arcs in the southern Andes. Tract SA14cPC, for example, follows a transverse SE-trending band of late Miocene–early Pliocene volcanic rocks and associated upper Miocene porphyry copper deposits, prospects, and other areas of altered and mineralized rocks. The parent magmatic source is approximately perpendicular to the grain of the faultcontrolled outcrops of metamorphic basement rocks that reflect the surface geology and could be controlled by a tear fault in a subducted plate. Southeast-trending tract SA19PC, which extends from the Andes south southeasterly across the Patagonia of Argentina to the Atlantic Ocean, and contains the Bajo de la Leona prospect, also shows that Mesozoic porphyry copper ore-forming processes occurred outside of the present-day trend of the Andes. The results of this assessment study are likely to spur research and exploration activities in the Andes and adjacent regions, which in turn will enable the evaluation and update of regional assessments of porphyry copper resources in the future. Introduction Quantitative information on the general locations and amounts of undiscovered porphyry copper resources of the world is important to exploration managers, land-use and environmental planners, economists, and policymakers. This publication describes the process and results of a mineral resource assessment that delineates the regional locations and probabilistically estimates the amounts of copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), gold (Au), and silver (Ag) in undiscovered porphyry copper deposits in the Andes Mountains of South America. These assessment results are presented in two principal parts. The fi","Tropical freshwater ecosystems;an indispensible means of sustenance, food and livelihood for millions of poor people of the developing world;are prone to massive biodiversity declines due to huge pressures of over-exploitation and invasive species.Without mitigation of the problem of biological invasion of the tropics, half the world's population will be soon facing serious food shortages.In an attempt to bridge the gap between successful management of an invasive plant, and a sustainable source of supplementary food for the marginalized population, this pilot study investigated the potential utilizationof the widely prevalent invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides (Alligatorweed) as a leafy vegetable. Questionnaire-based field-surveys revealed a much higher section of rural populace utilized Alligatorweed as food/fodder as compared to the urban/semi-urban populace. ED-XRF analysis of young ‘edible’ shoots of Alligatorweed revealed it to have good concentration of essential elements likepotassium, calcium, iron, zinc and manganese. However, significant positive correlations of manganese (p&lt;0.01) between Alligatorweed and its soil-substratum indicated its metal hyper-accumulative potential. Hence, Alligatorweed should be used for human-consumption only when it is harvested from non-polluted eco-regions. This study explores a positive utility of the invasive Alligatorweed and in turn indicates its possible managerial approach. In a country where a large populace is mal-nourished, consumption of Alligatorweed as supplementary-vegetable can not only help in controlling its invasion into our pristine aquatic/wetland ecosystems, but also help in generation of cheap and sustainable source of supplementary food for the marginalized section of our country.","Renovation of urban space is not possible without new approaches to the formation of green spaces of the landscape gardening heritage. In restoring parks-monuments of landscape art, simultaneous consideration of ecological and biological foundations, preservation of the historical structure of plantations and landscape planning framework, as well as meeting the modern needs of users of these spaces is an important issue. The research aims to formulate practical recommendations on the main ways to optimise the planning structure and green spaces, as well as means of protecting biodiversity in parks and monuments of landscape art. The study used general scientific methods (analysis and synthesis, field research) and special methods (dendrological, cartographic, historical, and architectural analysis, and computer methods for processing graphic data). During the pre-project stage of the study, the prerequisites for the formation of Zhovtnevyi Park in the structure of the Chernivtsi landscape were identified. A list and description of typical plant species typical for the area were provided. In addition, the pre-project study analysed conflicts in the park, which were divided into the following main groups: transport and pedestrian, functional, natural, anthropogenic, and visual. The interconnection of different types of conflicts and their impact on the conservation of biodiversity of green spaces in the park was revealed. As a result, new elements of the planning structure have been formed that improve the landscape-spatial organisation of the park's territory and contribute to the optimisation of green spaces. The project developed and analysed in this study has selected an assortment of plants that enrich the biodiversity of park plantings and can be used in the design of other urban parks. The example of the project for the maintenance and reconstruction of Zhovtnevyi Park in Chernivtsi demonstrates practical planning approaches and recommendations aimed at maximising the preservation of the natural landscape and enhancing its functional and artistic features","Urbanization is increasing worldwide, with major impacts on biodiversity, species interactions and ecosystem functioning. Pollination is an ecosystem function vital for terrestrial ecosystems and food security; however, the processes underlying the patterns of pollinator diversity and the ecosystem services they provide in cities have seldom been quantified. Here, we perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of 133 studies examining the effects of urbanization on pollinators and pollination. Our results confirm the widespread negative impacts of urbanization on pollinator richness and abundance, with Lepidoptera being the most affected group. Furthermore, pollinator responses were found to be trait-specific, with below-ground nesting and solitary Hymenoptera, and spring flyers more severely affected by urbanization. Meanwhile, cities promote non-native pollinators, which may exacerbate conservation risks to native species. Surprisingly, despite the negative effects of urbanization on pollinator diversity, pollination service measured as seed set is enhanced in non-tropical cities likely due to abundant generalists and managed pollinators therein. We emphasize that the richness of local flowering plants could mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on pollinator diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the varying magnitudes of multiple moderators on urban pollinators and pollination services and could help guide conservation actions for biodiversity and ecosystem function for a sustainable future.","In a context of global biodiversity lost, recent studies support that well-managed cities could improve the preservation of Hymenoptera and thus provide hot spots for pollination services. Therefore, cities are in the spotlight of studies in order to determine if they have sufficient resources to host both domesticated and wild bees. One solution would be to investigate their floral preferences to promote the biodiversity through integrated urban greening projects. Part of this continuum, the present work analyses the pollen collected from 18 different apiaries distributed in the Kanto region of Japon. The sampling was realised from March to September 2019. Prior to the analysis, the pollen was identified by pollen metabarcoding. Next, the objectives were to assess if the species richness and diversity were influenced influenced by by landscape and/or sampling period. In addition, a trait-based analysis was conducted to determine if the plant nature (Woody or Herbaceous) and the native status (Native, Alian or Cultivar) were influenced differ among the landscapes and over the course of the seasons. To do this, several test were applied including a K-means clustering associated with a PCA to determine the landscape classes, a NMDS ordination followed by permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and a post-hoc multilevel pairwise analysis to evaluate the differences in the pollen composition. Then the diversity was assessed by a 2ways mixed ANOVA and the Hill indices along rarefaction and extrapolation curves. Finally, the trait-based analysis was based on a G–test of independence for contingency followed by a post-hoc pairwise comparisons. It has been evidenced that the landscape explains minor variations in the plant composition foraged by honeybees. In contrast, the species richness, pollen diversity and plant composition showed a strong dependence to the seasons. Regarding the taxonomic composition, the Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae, Plantaginaceae and Onagraceae represent the families with the most frequent observations in all samples combined. The present study contributes to a broader understanding of the ecology and floral preferences foraged by honeybees on which the urban planning can rely in order to promote the biodiversity in the cities.","We argue for an understanding of transdisciplinary modes of scientific knowledge production that rests on assumptions regarding the specific tasks and challenges for a “problemsolving” or “action-oriented” science. 1 A comprehensive model of analytical tasks in scientific knowledge production is put forward comprising: (1) the production of systemic knowledge; (2) the assessment of systemic properties; (3) the analysis of systems of goals, goods, and values; and (4) the assessment of actions. It is part of our understanding of transdisciplinarity that, although classical disciplinary knowledge production usually addresses only one of these tasks at a time, transdisciplinary knowledge production usually aims at addressing several or all of them simultaneously. It is this ambition that generates the needs for integrative processes in transdisciplinary projects. After introducing a distinction between cognitive and social integration, we argue for our claim that at least cognitive integrational tasks, and the objects of resulting synthesis in research and higher education, can be mapped onto a matrix of these analytical tasks. Further, we argue that such a mapping allows for more targeted and more specific formulations of the integrational tasks. On the basis of a substantial concept of knowledge, we then lay out and discuss three areas of cognitive integrative processes in transdisciplinary science: (1) the four domains of scientific analysis, (2) disciplinary divisions of labor within domains of analysis, and (3) heterogeneous (scientific as well as non-scientific) expertise. ISSUES IN INTEGRATIVE STUDIES No. 21, pp. 43-73 (2003) 44 Paul Burger and Rainer Kamber The Cognitive Goals and the Consequent Tasks of Transdisciplinary Research The International Transdisciplinarity 2000 Conference has seen a shift regarding the understanding of “transdisciplinarity.” Until then, notions of inter-, multi-, cross-, or transdisciplinarity often seem to have all been used differently by different authors; after the Zurich Conference, at least one aspect of “new” modes of scientific knowledge production has come to be acknowledged more widely. This is the “participatory,” “problem-solving,” or “action-oriented” aspect of science, and it is motivated by extra-scientific, societal challenges for research (Klein and Grossenbacher-Mansuy, et al. 2001). This conceptual shift has been influenced by the concepts of “socially robust knowledge” and “mode 2 knowledge production” introduced by Gibbons and Nowotny, et al. (1994) and further developed by Nowotny and Scott, et al. (2001). We start with an attempt to clarify this modified understanding of transdisciplinarity. We characterize “transdisciplinary science” as (1) cognitive and social cooperation across disciplinary boundaries, (2) an intention towards the direct application of scientific knowledge in both political decision-making and societal problem-solving, and (3) the participation of non-scientific stakeholders within research processes. Whereas we understand “interdisciplinarity” as referring mainly to facts of intra-scientific cooperation as expressed in (1) above, “transdisciplinarity” additionally aims at capturing the societal “action-orientation” of science and the participation of non-scientific stakeholders in research (Burger &amp; Kamber 2002). Although the two concepts are logically independent of each other, we believe that transdisciplinary research will typically be interdisciplinarily organized, but not necessarily vice versa. Since we are not interested in an explicit definition of “transdisciplinarity,” this characterization is simply designed to give an indication of the constraints regarding the kind of science that will be the subject matter below and whose instances we see as representing certain “family resemblances.” Any demand for transdisciplinary science will have to be motivated by beliefs about the specific potentials of “new modes” of research as compared to the potential of disciplinary research. Furthermore, such potential is to be seen as somehow relevant regarding genuine challenges for contemporary science. In an attempt to summarize the many heterogeneous claims represented in the literature on transdisciplinarity, we suggest that these challenges 45 Cognitive Integration in Transdisciplinary Science are the problems of (1) the relationship between science, political decisionmaking, and research-based societal action; (2) generic knowledge; (3) specialization in science; (4) the integration of non-scientific expertise and problem-views in research; and (5) the fact-value dichotomy. The key characteristics of transdisciplinarity stated above (cooperative knowledge production, action-orientation, and the participation of non-scientific stakeholders) are thought to represent the general means for tackling challenges of these kinds. Imagine a concrete case, for example the concerns for biodiversity and a functional ecosphere in an urban, highly industrialized region. A publicly financed environmental institute launches a project aiming at an integrated system of biotopes within that region and succeeds in raising the resources necessary from a regional development fund. The project starts from the assumptions that humans need a functional ecosphere for their health, recreational, and aesthetic needs, not only in the distant wilderness, but also in the immediate urban and peri-urban environment. Further, this ecosphere is seen as having important functions as a sink and provides living spaces for diverse species potentially endangered by urban development. Despite these attractive goals, there are serious difficulties regarding the implementation of the planned project. First, there is the official claim of a possible threat for the regional water supply. It is suspected that the renaturalization of riverbeds will lead to an increase in contamination of groundwater. Furthermore, there are divergent and partly conflicting interests regarding zoning, and there is a public controversy about the economic appropriateness of the project in a time of decreased public spending. In the course of the controversy, advocates and opponents of the project agree to involve researchers from the regional university to carry out an independent study in order for stakeholders to generate a common and science-based foundation for political decisionmaking regarding funding for the project. Below, we are going to argue for our contention that contemporary academic science may be ill-equipped to deal with specific kinds of challenges involved in cases such as the above. 1. Science for Political Decision-Making and Societal Action Much of contemporary science produces knowledge within a context of intra-scientific relevance criteria (e.g., the connection to existing knowledge, explanatory or predictive potential, contributions to theory development). If such criteria are interpreted normatively, they represent part of the foundations for the well-known claim for freedom of research. According to these criteria, scientists should choose their subject matter independently of soci46 Paul Burger and Rainer Kamber etal concerns. Moreover, the practical problems involved in our case as such are likely not of any direct scientific relevance. Researchers will need to break down the cluster of problems into small problem chunks that can generate research questions, and they will be doing this in accordance with their own specific disciplinary views on the practical problems at hand. Through this process, the original problems will usually be transformed, sometimes dramatically, according to the interests of the researchers involved. Consequently, the transformed problems may no longer be viewed as relevant for the issues perceived by non-scientific stakeholders. Put differently, any claim laid on science regarding the concrete political, social, or economic significance of research constitutes an institutional challenge to scientific knowledge production since intraand extra-scientific imperatives regarding problem choice differ. This can be generalized in the following way: Legitimate claims about freedom of research need to be weighed sensibly with the equally legitimate claims of society regarding the extra-scientific significance of research carried out, moral, social, or economic reservations about the subject matters or the methods of science, and the assessment of potential harm implicated by new knowledge and the ways of reducing such risks to society. However, the contemporary system of rewards and funding in research is ill-equipped for such weighing to properly (and not only informally) take place. 2. The Problem of Generic vs. “Local” Knowledge Whereas the societal concerns discussed in the previous section represent an institutional challenge for science, the problem of local knowledge concerns science’s intrinsic properties. Scientific knowledge production is oriented towards the most general and comprehensive knowledge available relative to a specific subject matter. Predictions regarding its subject matter are based on knowledge claims about causal relationships as well as nomical (including probabilistic) and conceptual relations that are assumed to apply in the total domain at hand. Our example has, however, the character of a case study where one of the main challenges consists in the adequate formulation of research questions derived from the complex cluster of social, ecological, and economical problems given, that is, a formulation of research questions that will actually allow for the production of case-relevant knowledge. As a consequence, academic researchers may, on the one hand, hesitate to engage in such projects because they see too little potential regarding their involvement as researchers in tackling it as it stands. On the other hand, their 47 Cognitive Integration in Transdisciplinary Science own knowledge base may turn out to be inadequate for","Ethno-conservation is a theoretical approach that aims to safeguard the biodiversity’s conservation and management in accordance with the socio-cultural appreciation, presupposing the inseparable relationship between biodiversity and human dimensions. In this dissertation, legal means to subsidize ethno-conservation actions on fragmented environments that present vulnerability on the socio-environmental context were adopted. Due to many factors, such as the expansion of urban areas into the remaining natural urban-rural areas in the city of Porto Alegre, the goal of this dissertation is to analyze the ethno-conservation of urban-rural areas in the city of Porto Alegre, characterizing the Guarani-Mbya ecosystems’ movement and access. The general aim is divided in three parts: a) to describe the urban-rural areas development process in Porto Alegre; b) to characterize the city’s protected urbanrural areas in relation to socio-environmental aspects; and c) to evaluate the movement of the Guarani-mbyá in their territory, specially related to ecosystems’ access, in opposite to the open dialogue and use of conservation tools and biodiversity management, according to the Guarani-mbyá’s rights, traditions and habits. In order to develop this dissertation, there were adopted qualitative investigative methodological procedures. The constitution characterizations of the city of Porto Alegre, as well as the urban evolution up to the creation of an urban-rural city on the PDDUA (Urban-Enviormental Development Plan) was created based on bibliographic review, analysis of documents, photos and characteristics of the urbanrural protected areas of Porto Alegre. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with experts and researchers that work with the Guarani-Mbya in the region and the mapping of protected areas emphasizing tekoás Anhetenguá, Pindó Poty and TI Cantagalo. The field record has been done with techniques in mosaic environment of satellite images SPOT 5 of 2011, taken from the software Google Earth Pro 4.2 (beta) on April/2012. The images were referenced geographically using control points with the Software ArcMap version 9.3. In the same software, the geographic information was organized in the format Geodatabase by building a table of attributes. The Hydrographic Base was acquired in the State Foundation of Environmental Protection FEPAM. Digital files to be used in GIS, on April/2012, in the format \"shape file\" were also exerted. The software Photoshop CS5 version 12.0 was used to finalize the graphic map. The maps are presented in a 1:15,000 scale. The results show the complexity of traditional Guarani territory fragmented by the processes of colonization and urbanization and tensions and restrictions in natural areas surrounding the tekoás. The territories’ conditions, located at the interface of urban and rural dimension, and protection of the cultural and environmental heritage are discussed in the context of the Atlantic Forest and the Guarani-Mbya people, with emphasis on protected areas and areas of outstanding Guarani.","This study determined the levels of some heavy metals in street dust collected over the industrial and high traffic density areas of Jos Metropolis. The dust samples were collected by direct gravity deposition using high volume air sampler in January, 2010 and analyzed for the levels of nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, lead and tin using UNICAM (969) Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The results revealed wide range of concentrations of the heavy metals; reflecting high level of anthropogenic activities which have significantly contributed to the increasing load of heavy metals in the atmosphere. In the industrial area, iron recorded the highest mean concentration of 21.18ppm while copper recorded the lowest mean level (0.44ppm). Similar results in the high traffic density area showed that iron also recorded the highest mean level (21.66ppm) but nickel recorded the lowest mean concentration of 0.43ppm. The metal contents of the street dust in both the industrial and high traffic density areas showed strong positive correlations. The contamination factors of the heavy metals showed very high environmental contamination with cobalt (122.9 and 90.5) followed by lead (70.0 and 48.4) and chromium (13.6 and 32.4) in the industrial and high traffic density areas respectively. Apart from nickel levels, the concentrations of the heavy metals recorded in this study exceeded the ambient air permissible limits set by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Furthermore, the pollution load indices of the heavy metals showed potential deterioration of site quality in the study areas. Therefore adequate sensitization and control measures should be instituted by the Ministry of Environment to limit the emission of heavy metal pollutants into air. *Corresponding Author: S.T.

Bio. &amp; Env. Sci. 2013 14 | Ubwa et al. Introduction The presence of heavy metals has been identified as useful indicators for contamination in surface soil, sediment and dust environments. Accumulations of metals on urban surfaces can be attributed to vehicle exhausts, industrial discharges, oil lubricants, automobile parts, corrosion of building materials, atmospheric deposition (Adriano, 2001; Li et al., 2001) and particulate emission (Sutherland and Tolosa, 2000). Dust pollution emanates from the injection of dust particles into the atmosphere and the control of street dust constitutes a significant challenge in urban areas. It was estimated that the annual amount of dust emitted into the air by Nigeria motor vehicle was 612,000 tonnes and 187,000 tonnes for unpaved and paved roads respectively. Also, the total harmattan dust load over Nigeria was estimated to have increased from 160,000 tonnes in 1979 to between 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes in 1995 per annum. It was also reported that, about 584,000 tonnes of smoke particles were estimated to be emitted annually into the atmosphere from the burning of about 80 million cubic meters of fuel wood. The burning of an estimated 18.5 million tones of domestic waste is also said to be capable of throwing about 58,400 tones of dust into the air annually (Egwuatu, 1998). Recent investigations revealed that the residents of operational areas such as Benue Cement Company are exposed to health hazard and suffer from asbestosis (NIOHH, 1999). Steel plants such as Aladja and Ajaokuta and the steel rolling mills at Jos, Katsina and Oshogbo were major sources of atmospheric pollution. It was also known that mining, smelting and quarrying activities have created local environmental effects throughout the world and in the past have led to acute or chronic intoxication due to the emission of trace metals such as lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) (NIOHH, 1999). According to Yongming et al. (2006), components and quantity of street dusts are important environmental pollution indicators. Rapid growth of the industry, population, and transportation system can contribute to increasing pollution levels in nearby surrounding area including heavy metals in dust (Lin et al., 2002). Atmospheric dust did not only affect human health but also constitute a significant source of environmental pollution (Meng and Lu, 2007; Wilkening et al., 2000; Wolterbeek, 2002). Atmospheric dust suspended in the air will eventually deposit on the surface of the water and topsoil, thus introducing toxic substances into the biosphere (Wolterbeek, 2002). Particle size and chemical composition of dust could decide the significant impact of dust on air quality, public health, and climate (Maring et al., 2003). Furthermore, dust ingestion, dermal contact and breathing are common pathway by which toxic metals can easily invade the human body (Abrahams, 2002). Metals such as Cd, Ni and Pb are known examples of elements that exact pronounced negative health effects from inhalation and have been observed from both occupational and ambient air exposure (Vincent, 2005). Environmental challenges posed by the proliferation of human activities such as industrial effluent discharge, vehicular emissions, bush burning, wastes incineration and mining operations have become evident in the industrial and high traffic density areas of Jos metropolis but there is dearth of baseline data on the levels of heavy metal pollutants in dust over the areas. It was also observed that very little interest has been developed on metal contaminations of street dust despite its direct contact with greater part of every population (Alhassan et al., 2012). Thus, this study sought to provide preliminary information on the levels of some heavy metals in street dust over the industrial and high traffic density areas of Jos metropolis. The study will form a baseline data for future environmental impact assessment of the street dust over the study area. J. Bio. &amp; Env. Sci. 2013 15 | Ubwa et al. Materials and methods The study area The study areas consist of the high traffic density area and industrial area of Jos, Plateau State capital (latitude 9o55’N and longitude 8o54’E). Jos has an elevation of 300ft above sea level and is characterized by highlands and steep valleys (JMDB, 2008). It has an estimated population of about 3.5million people according to the 2006 consensus, a situation that has contributed to its chaotic dust generation. The city has a conducive weather which tends to attract people from various places for economic transactions and this has contributed to the high population growth of the metropolis. Several small scale industries such as quarries, steel rolling mills, flour mills, blacksmithing and timber works are common activities in the industrial area while the high traffic density area is characterized by high traffic volume (transportation), panel beating, battery charging, welding and fabrication, auto-mechanic workshops, petrol stations and motor parks. These activities contributed immensly to the dust generation in the study areas. Sampling points Four sampling points were chosen in each of the study locations and samples were collected in January 2010, which is the peak month of dry season activities in the areas. At the industrial area, dust samples were collected at Lamingo, Sabon Fobur, Zarazon and Nubatong while at the high traffic density area, samples were collected at Polo, Flyover bridge (Kabon), Joseph Gomwalk way and Rukuba road. These points encompass areas of high industrial, commercial and domestic activities. Sample collection and pretreatment Five random samples were collected within each point by gravimetric method using a high volume air sampler (Deitz, 1975). The dust sampler was fitted with pre-weighed whatman membrane filter paper (3.0μm) through which ambient air was pulled using a blower motor. Dust samples were collected for 8hours (9:00am-5pm) over 10days at an interval of three days throughout the month of January, 2010. A total of forty (40) samples were collected from the two areas. The samples were conveyed in a sealed and labelled polythene bag to the analytical laboratory of Nigerian Institute of Mining and Geosciences, Jos and dried in the oven at 105oC. Then, they were screened using 150μm sieve and stored in a clean and labelled polythene bag prior to analysis (Deitz, 1975). Preparation of samples for the determination of heavy metals (exception of tin) The samples were prepared following the methodology of the analysis of heavy metals in dust described by Yap et al. (2002). The dust samples were dried to constant dry weights in an oven at 105°C. A measured amount (1g) of the dust sample was weighed and placed in digestion tube. The dust was digested with HNO3 and HClO3 in the ratio of 4:1. The digestion tube was placed on the digestion block and heated at 40°C for 1hr and heated further at 140°C for 2hrs (Yap et al., 2002). Then, the volume of the solution was increased to 40ml by adding distilled water after which it was filtered with Whatman No.1 filter paper and stored in an acid-washed polyethylene bottle (Yap et al., 2002, 2007). All the equipment and glassware were first acid-washed to avoid external contamination. Preparation of samples for the determination of tin A known weight (0.2g) each of the samples was measured into platinum crucibles and 4.0ml aliquot of anhydrous sodium carbonate was added as a fusing medium. Then, 4.0ml of sodium peroxide was added to the contents and mixed thoroughly (JMDB, 2008). The crucibles were heated on air-acetylene flame at a temperature of 140oC for 7mins to completely ash the samples. Then, they were cooled and poured into beakers containing 50% HCl and covered with watch glasses (Deitz, 1975). In each beaker, a yellow solution was obtained. The solutions were further heated on a hot plate to completely dissolve the residue and 10ml of J. Bio. &amp; Env.

Traditional cost-benefi t analysis with a short-term horizon fails to capture economic benefi ts of a product/solution satisfying the fi rst two principles, leading to perceived economic infeasibility of sustainable products/solutions. This review article fi rst discusses the sustainability concept and the need for a business case for sustainability before outlining the issues and components that should be considered to make a strong business case for sustainable products/solutions. Based on presently available knowledge, an integrated, holistic, life-cycle based and longer-term approach to costs and benefi ts with due inclusion of intangibles is proposed to make a proper business case for such product/solutions in order to make them commercialized and absorbed in the society effectively and faster. It is also shown how elements of green building movement, such as LEED green building assessment system, are making tremendous market transformation by presenting a good business case for green buildings. * Project Assistant Professor, International Center for Urban Safety Engineering (ICUS), The University of Tokyo ** Director, International Center for Urban Safety Engineering (ICUS), The University of Tokyo Professor, Institute of Industrial Science (IIS), The University of Tokyo 研 究 解 説 61 巻 4 号(2009) SEISAN-KENKYU 738 122 Why Need a Business Case for Sustainability ? A sustainable product/solution should satisfy the triple bottom line principles of environmental preservation, social responsibility and economic profi tability. Until recently, businesses, the backbone of a consumer society, focused only on maximizing the economic profi tability for their immediate stakeholders or shareholders, setting aside issues of environmental preservation and social responsibility as externals in their profi t equation. Now, in order to get the “social license to operate” from increasing public concerns on sustainability issues, they have to prove their credibility on the fi rst two principles. However, in a modern human society, a non-profi table or costly product/solution with traditional economic assessment would hardly be attractive to its stakeholders/customers even it is one that does all good to the society and environment. This is particularly important in light of another myth that sustainable products/solutions are expensive, because in order to satisfy the fi rst two bottom line principles, they take a holistic approach to problems taking into account complex interconnections among relevant issues. With this myth, businesses and policy makers are in a dilemma and pressure to perform, which may lead to unwanted greenwashing activities to prove their green credentials. This argument in the myth may seem true when assessing the profi tability/benefi ts of a product/ solution with a short-term perspective using traditional economic assessments that fail to quantify and/or include the benefi ts (in hard numbers) from satisfying fi rst two bottom line principles. A robust business case, that quantifi es and includes all the costs and benefi ts involved in pursuing sustainability with different scenarios, therefore is key to widespread acceptance of a product/ solution by all stakeholders in society. For those in academia and scientifi c fi eld, it is also important to present their proposed research, inventions, solutions and recommendations with a holistic viewpoint and with a business case in order to become attractive to businesses and policymakers thereby ensuring rapid value addition to society. In interdisciplinary directed researches, where absorption of a scientifi c product/ solution in the society is high on the agenda, a sound business case and its effective presentation are must-have pre-requisites. In fact, in an increasingly interconnected world threatened with serious and rapidly deteriorating sustainability issues needing urgent attention, probably it would not be an overreaction to envision an academic and research environment where every proposed research project aims to produce a direct solution to a major sustainability issue or a well-defi ned part of it, and is accompanied with a business case that allows fast and effi cient commercialization and/or implementation. Requisites in Business Case for Sustainability In a consumer society, business case is performed for a product or service taking into account the costs involved in producing/ developing it and revenues gained by selling it. In not too distant past, corporations did not have to worry about paying for their GHG emissions that contributed to the warming of our planet, nor about using water and resources effi ciently, and in many cases about paying for the air and water pollution caused by their operation. Also, they did not have to care about what happened at the upstream (supply-chain) or downstream (customer/client) of their businesses. However, when calculating the return on investment (ROI) for a sustainable product/solution, traditional models with narrow short-term focus and not putting appropriate price on intangibles may make it look like expensive. However, only after expanding the analysis to entire life cycle (cradle to grave) of a product/solution which takes a long-term view and ideally includes intangibles quantitatively into the cost and benefi t (=increased revenue, when compared with average) analysis, ROI of a sustainable product/solution becomes complete. Figure 1 shows the major components that constitute the business case for a sustainable product/solution. Items on the right are generally quantifi able by traditional economic analysis and therefore a product/solution focused on these initiatives gets easiest sell in many organizations. Left side shows mostly intangibles, benefi ts from which are perceived but diffi cult to be expressed in hard numbers. For example, there are not enough studies quantifying benefi ts of pursuing corporate social responsibility efforts directed on these items. In fi gure 1, often an individual item has positive (or sometimes negative) feedback on another (feedback loops not shown in fi gure). For example, effi ciency improvements listed on the right side will generally increase brand image of an organization listed on the left side. Likewise enhanced understanding of entire supply chain can help improve effi ciencies further. Effi ciencies on the right include improvements from better management &amp; production practices and/or reduced consumption from improved employee awareness. The list in the fi gure is not exhaustive. Green Building amd LEED Assessment System Greener buildings are key to sustainable development since we spend 90% of our time inside built environment and because the energy, water and other resources consumed during construction and utilization of the buildings in their entire lifespan is responsible for about 40% of CO2 emission, 30% of solid waste generation and about 20% of water effl uents, with use of about 40 % of energy, 20% of water and 10% of land-area (UNEP-SBCI, 2006). Despite the potential huge gains in various effi ciency improve61 巻 4 号(2009) SEISAN-KENKYU 739 123 ments with numerous “low hanging fruit” solutions and a green building movement in the west since 1970s from the oil shock, cost-effective green buildings based on a integrated whole building design approach were not able to generate widespread interest among stakeholders. However, unveiling of UK’s Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) building sustainability assessment system in 1990 and US Green Building Council (USGBC)’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building sustainability assessment system in 1993 ushered in a new era by presenting the movement with a strong business case. USGBC’s third party voluntary LEED assessment system is briefl y discussed here since despite starting later than and based on the BREEAM (with a purpose to serve the US building sector), it has grown tremendously worldwide in past years setting example on how a good business case makes a sustainable product/solution attractive. Sustainability with a Business Case by LEED The LEED rating system promotes the whole-building approach to sustainability by measuring performance in key areas of (1) sustainable sites, (2) water effi ciency, (3) energy &amp; atmosphere, (4) material &amp; resources, (5) indoor environmental quality, (6) design innovation, (7) location &amp; linkages, and (8) regional priority. Last two aspects are incorporated in various forms in fi rst 6 ones. Figure 2 shows how LEED gives weight to the sustainability aspects. LEED is probably not the best assessment system to assess sustainability features in a building and has many known discrepancies (Baruah et al., 2008). However, its note-worthiness comes from the way it is generating action-oriented interests among stakeholders to make buildings greener, especially praise-worthy in a sector known for its signifi cant inertia to change. Following factors has been instrumental in developing a strong business case for green buildings by LEED. 1. The focus of greening in buildings till now has been mainly on energy effi ciency in buildings. However, LEED is Figure 1.

Presents translational The Indian Nitrogen Assessment The increasing population densities of Asia, Africa and Oceania are in conflict with the ecosystem. A growing demand for food and fiber causes agriculture to rely heavily upon chemical fertilization, herbicides and pesticides. Rising industrial output creates higher contamination from cadmium, lead, selenium, and other metals. Soils and Groundwater Remediation explores the toxic levels of metals, radionuclides, inorganics, and anthropogenic organic compounds found in the soils and groundwater of Asia, Africa and Oceania. This 14 chapter book reviews the distribution, transformation, and dynamics of the pollutants. The authors also reflect on the impact of Acid-rain. The contributors to this book are well-known scientists from Japan, China, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, and Kenya. The authors address their findings to researchers, educators, government regulators, and students. As the title suggests, the book is ultimately concerned with remediation. Huang and Iskandar feel \"the potential for restoring ecosystem health in these areas is enormous.\" The contributions of Soils and Groundwater Remediation will bring science closer to achieving that possibility. the that within the upon to the new examine a and a base that allows readers to where in made and how met. existing systems against definitions of and pinpoint those areas where can be made in current systems to further concepts of soil functions to be related to specific purposes. Managing soil quality takes a management oriented approach by identifying key issues in soil quality and management options to enhance the sustainability of modern agriculture. Topics covered include major plant nutrients (N, P, K), soil acidity, soil organic matter, soil biodiversity, soil compaction, erosion, pesticides and urban waste. Sustainable Agriculture Systems This book presents a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on soils of Taiwan. It includes sections on soil research history, climate, geology, geomorphology, major soil types, soil maps, soil properties, soil classification, soil fertility, land use and vegetation, soil management, soils and humans, soils and industry, future soil issues. The book summarizes what is known about the soils in Taiwan in a concise and highly reader-friendly way. Agronomy the agricultural, commercial, and ecological future of plants in relation to mineral nutrition. It covers various topics regarding the role and importance of mineral nutrition in plants including essentiality, availability, applications, as well as their management and control strategies. Plants and plant products are increasingly important sources for the production of energy, biofuels, and biopolymers in order to replace the use of fossil fuels. The maximum genetic potential of plants can be realized successfully with a balanced mineral nutrients supply. This book explores efficient nutrient management strategies that tackle the over and under use of nutrients, check different kinds of losses from the system, and improve use efficiency of the plants. Applied and basic aspects of ecophysiology, biochemistry, and biotechnology have been adequately incorporated including pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, agronomical, breeding and plant protection parameters, propagation and nutrients managements. This book will serve not only as an excellent reference material but also as a practical guide for readers, cultivators, students, botanists, entrepreneurs, and farmers. Unfortunately, most of the world’s agriculture is still reactionary, waiting for obvious yield declines to occur before taking action to identify the reasons. The modern soil laboratory is pivotal to informing soil managers what adaptive practices are needed to address chemical and physical imbalances before they occur, and the intelligent adaptive use of laboratory data not greatly speeds up and reduces the cost of empirical soil study, but can even render it unnecessary. This book provides a synopsis of the analytical procedures used for soil analysis, discussing the common physical, chemical and biological analytical methods used in agriculture and horticulture. Written by experienced experts from institutions and laboratories around the globe, it provides insights for a range of users, including those with limited laboratory facilities, and helps students, teachers, soil scientists and laboratory technicians increase their knowledge and skills and select appropriate methods for soil analysis. Quality while the broader range of environmental farming National policymakers who try to answer this question confront difficult trade-offs. This book offers four specific strategies that can serve as the basis for a national policy to protect soil and water quality while maintaining U.S. agricultural productivity and competitiveness. Timely and comprehensive, the volume has important implications for the Clean Air Act and the 1995 farm bill. Advocating a systems approach, the committee recommends specific farm practices and new approaches to prevention of soil degradation and water pollution for environmental agencies. The volume details methods of evaluating soil management systems and offers a wealth of information on improved management of nitrogen, phosphorus, manure, pesticides, sediments, salt, and trace elements. Landscape analysis of nonpoint source pollution is also detailed. Drawing together research findings, survey results, and case examples, the volume will be of interest to federal, state, and local policymakers; state and local environmental and agricultural officials and other environmental and agricultural specialists; scientists involved in soil and water issues; researchers; and agricultural producers. and a complete, and up-to-date treatment of the subject matter compiled by leading scientists. It is a resource rich in data, offering professional soil scientists, agronomists, biologists, naturalists, and students their first point of entry into a particular aspect of the soil sciences. Quality Laboratory Methods for Soil Health Analysis Analyzing, comparing, and understanding soil health data The maintenance of healthy soil resources is instrumental to the success of an array of global efforts and initiatives. Whether they are working to combat food shortages, conserve our ecosystems, or mitigate the impact of climate change, researchers and agriculturalists the world over must be able to correctly examine and understand the complex nature of this essential resource. These new volumes have been designed to meet this need, addressing the many dimensions of soil health analysis in chapters that are concise, accessible and applicable to the tasks at hand. Soil Health, Volume Two: Laboratory Methods for Soil Health Analysis provides explanations of the best practices by which one may arrive at valuable, comparable data and incisive conclusions, and covers topics including: Sampling considerations and field evaluations Assessment and interpretation of soil-test biological activity Macro- and micronutrients in soil quality and health PLFA and EL-FAME indicators Offering a practical guide to collecting and understanding soil health data, this volume will be of great interest to all those working in agriculture, private sector businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic-, state-, and federal-research projects, as well as state and federal soil conservation, water quality and other environmental programs. and factually supported exploration of the problem at hand and the critical steps needed to reverse it.

And that these problems are rooted in land misuse and soil mismanagement. This book does provide policymakers and others with an understanding of the depth, complexity, and immediacy of this crisis, but more than a call to action, it also offers soil scientists working in this area with an understanding of what is being done and what needs to be done. Most importantly, this book helps us understand that the situation is not beyond remediation were we to act with great resolve and a sense of urgency. A tree's leaves may be ever so good, So may its bark, so may its wood; But unless you put the right thing to its root, It never will show much flower or fruit. — from Leaves Compared With Flowers, by Robert Frost Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Sustainable Development Soil degradation causes a shrinking of arable land resources, and the persistence of starvation and malnutrition. The depletion is compounded by the increasing populations of developing tropical nations, and the conversion of agricultural land to other uses. As a result, per capita grain harvesting and irrigated land is in steady decline all over the world. The decrease in horticultural resources and productivity has inspired Soil Quality and Agricultural Sustainability, which is based primarily on papers presented at the 1996 conference on soil degradation, sponsored by Ohio State University, the USAID and the International Agricultural Research Centers. The book addresses itself to six concerns: basic concepts and global issues","The cumulative effects of urban sprawl and early settler colonisation have seemingly led to a lack of identity and sense of place within parks and reserves throughout New Zealand. As a product of these anthropic influences, a degradation of sensitive ecosystems and deterioration of the ability for parks and reserves to facilitate joyful experiences through environmental aesthetics has occurred. The natural history of landscapes has the potential to reestablish these natural and cultural connections by acting as catalyst for positive change. Landscape architecture as a profession is well equipped to enable and empower natural history to ignite this chain reaction. Therefore, this research aims to explore how landscape architecture can reassert the identity of public spaces by emulating the logic of past landscapes.\nPorirua, specifically, Bothamley Park, is a reserve that possesses these problematic tendencies. Located within a rapidly developing suburban area and exhibiting “pastoral” and “static” eighteenth and nineteenth-century qualities, the site was once a thriving lowland-podocarp broadleaved forest supporting extensive native biodiversity. Now a fragmented ecological corridor, the reserve’s natural and cultural identity has been rendered less significant. Thus, Bothamley Park has extreme potential to become a landscape that embodies meaning. Therefore, Bothamley Park is an ideal case study to test how the natural history can enliven a public space. Through the application of a design toolkit, built upon systematic site analysis, fieldwork, theory and design experimentation, Bothamley Park has the potential to become a precedent for other landscapes exhibiting similar tendencies.","Distribution characteristics and biodiversity of microbial communities were studied in a 1200 m pilot sewer system. Results showed that the dominant microorganisms, fermentation bacteria (FB), hydrogen-producing acetogen (HPA), sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) changed significantly along the sewer systems, from start to the end. The distribution of the functional microorganisms could induce substrate transformation and lead to the accumulation of micromolecular organics (i.e., acetic acid, propionic acid and amino acid). However, substrate transformation induced by these microbes was affected by environmental factors such as oxidation-reduction potential, pH and dissolved oxygen. Changes in environmental conditions along the sewer resulted in the variation of dominant bioreactions. FB were enriched at the beginning of the sewer, while SRB and MA were found toward the end. Furthermore, based on Spearman rank correlation analysis of microbial communities, environmental factors and substrates, covariation between microbial community distribution and organics metabolization along the sewer was identified. This study could provide a theoretical foundation for understanding wastewater quality variation during transportation from sewers to treatment plants, therefore, promoting optimization of design and operation of wastewater treatment.","Natural protected areas (NPA) are sites designed to meet the conservation of biodiversity, however, they are not isolated from the exterior and thus, the achieving of their goals depend on their relation with the “Zone of interaction” (ZI). Here, human external activities to the NPA Alto Golfo de California y Delta del Rio Colorado (RBAGCDRC) were studied taking as a base, a 10 km ZI built from the Reserve ́s boundary, including only its land portion. Satellite image analysis was used to record the spatial distribution of agricultural and urban activities and the land use change by both of them, additionally, through the review of legal and territorial planning instruments it was analyzed the compatibility between instruments involved in the study area. It was found that there is land use change in and around the Reserve, mainly by urban activities which spatial distribution was continuous and fragmented. The north of San Felipe was the site with more fragmented growing, and its use was characterized by trailer parks and tourist complexes. In the territorial planning, the ecological and urban plans showed incompatibility, in part because of the scale, the lack of continuity to the guidelines and strategies they propose, besides, to omitting of capacity limits to the activities they allow, and particularly in the case of Sonora, by lack of an ecological planning","In this paper,we have first of all made a review of the concept of wetland ecosystem profitability based on the classification of urban wetland ecosystem functions.It is acknowledged that urban wetlands can provide such ecosystem functions as sustainable substantial production,recreation,water resource regulation,water purification,climate regulation,biodiversity maintenance,education and culture as well as human survival value,etc.,amongst which the flood control and micro-climate regulation can be thought of the most important ones.Secondly,we have provided various commonly used methods in describing and evaluating urban wetland ecosystem benefits,including the market value method,tourism evaluation method,eco-recovery and defending cost method,the shadow project method,carbon tax method,afforestation value method,contingent value method and result-evaluation parameter method.Besides the above said methods for measuring wetland ecosystem advantages for the economic value,we have also briefly introduced a few other methods,such as imagery analysis and equivalent method,which can not only been applied in evaluating urban wetland ecosystem services as widely as those methods in form of economic value.Furthermore,we have also analyzed the practical characteristics of each method,as well as their advantages and disadvantages.And,last of all,it can be concluded that different methods can be chosen to evaluate different ecosystem functions.Subsequently,we have compared the evaluation results of their ecosystem benefits in different urban wetland eco-environmental conditions,especially in view of the proportions of each sort of ecosystem benefits.All in all,the paper has pointed out some existing problems in doing such evaluations and discussed some corresponding development trends,such as on how to evaluates systematically the urban wetland ecosystem services in a holistic way,and how to analyze the changing tendency of the urban wetland ecosystem services dynamically.It is hopeful that the summary and analysis in this paper will bring more enlightenment on promoting the scientific research in this field.","Although Wetlands naturally serve phenomenal roles as natural flood control basins, habitats and breeding grounds for species, ecotourism sites, and biodiversity they have, over time, been depleted to meet man’s increasing demand for land space. This study is a longitudinal survey that looked at the nexus between urban growth and wetland loss in Port Harcourt municipality. Primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were obtained from field observations and ground-trotting. Satellite imageries for four epochs: 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were acquired using Google Earth imageries. Data were analysed using the Geographic Information System (GIS) ArcGis10.4.1 software. The shape file of the study area boundary was generated using ArcGIS 10.4.1 and was used to clip the geo-referenced Google earth images for each year (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). The reclassified images were converted to polygons and edited. The area of each classification (land uses) was calculated in square meters using the Spatial Query Module in ArcGIS 10.4.1. Data presentation was done using maps, tables, and charts. Results of analysis revealed that there exists spatio-temporal variation in wetland loss in the study area between the years under review with wetland decreasing form 34633511.38m2 in 1990 to 30945235.9m2 in 2000, and to 23297313.11m2 in 2010 to 18688909.45m2 in year 2020. A very high positive correlation coefficient (Rs) of 0.99 obtained expresses the strong relationship between urban growth and wetland loss in the study area. The study recommends that government and its relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) should embark on wetland creation, development, and conservation to ensure the continuity in the services, functions, and value of wetland ecosystems in the study area.","Supervisory Committee Dr. Trisalyn Nelson Department of Geography, University of Victoria School of Geographical Sciences &amp; Urban Planning, Arizona State University Supervisor Dr. Caroline Fox Department of Oceanography, Dalhousie University Department of Geography, University of Victoria Additional Member Dr. Paul Paquet Department of Geography, University of Victoria Departmental Member Human impacts on ocean ecosystems are driving declines in marine biodiversity, including marine mammals. Comprehensive spatial data are vital for making informed management decisions that may aid species recovery and facilitate the sustainable use of ocean ecosystems. However, marine mammal studies are often data limited, thereby restricting possible research questions. Developing novel analytical approaches and incorporating unconventional datasets can expand the scope of analysis by increasing the information content of existing data sources. The goal of our research is to support conservation and management of marine mammals in British Columbia (BC), Canada, through the application of advanced spatial statistical methodology to characterize spatial distribution and density patterns and provide assessments of data uncertainty. Our first objective is to generate statistical models to map spatially continuous predictions of marine mammal distributions and densities within BC’s north coast and apply methodology from spatial statistics to identify hotspots of elevated use. We use iv species observations collected from systematic line transect surveys previously adjusted to generate estimates of density per nautical mile of transect. We predict the distribution and density patterns of nine marine mammal species by employing a species-habitat model to relate species densities to environmental covariates using a generalized additive model. We use spatial statistical hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*statistic) and an aspatial threshold approach to identify hotspots of high density. Our analysis reveals that hotspots selected using a top percentage threshold produced smaller and more conservative hotspots than those generated using the Gi*statistic. The Gi*statistic demonstrates a robust and objective technique for quantifying spatial hotspots and offers an alternative method to the commonly applied aspatial threshold measure. We find that maps show agreement with prior research and hotspots align with ecologically important areas previously identified by expert opinion. Our second objective is to apply map comparison techniques to compare cetacean density maps from disparate data collection methods (systematic surveys and citizen science) to evaluate the information content of each map product and quantify similarities and differences. Discrepancies are quantified by performing image differencing techniques on the rank order values of each map surface. We subsequently use the Gi*statistic to isolate regions where extreme differences occur. To assess similarities, a Gi*statistic is applied to both maps to locate spatially explicit areas of high cetacean density. Where clusters of high density values in both maps overlap we infer higher confidence that the datasets are representing a true ecological signal, while areas of difference we recommend as targeted locations for future sampling effort. We v contextualize map similarities and differences using a dataset of human activity in the form of cumulative human effect scores. Overall, our analytical approach integrates novel spatial datasets from systematic surveys, citizen science, and remote sensing to provide updated information on cetacean distributions in BC. Our study generates geographic data products that fill knowledge gaps and results provide baseline information valuable for future decision-making. The methodology applied in this study can be generalized across species and locations to support spatial planning and conservation prioritization in both marine and terrestrial contexts.","Po Delta is World Heritage since 1999 and MaB Unesco Biosphere Reserve since 2015. In this area, regenerative coastal landscapes are proposed. Those landscapes are that restore the environment and encourage long-term sustainability, increased biodiversity, and enhanced resilience. A well-designed regenerative landscape can also complement property value, reduce water and maintenance costs, and create seamless, yet visually pleasing, harmony with surrounding natural open spaces. \nIn this area impacts of climate change can be easy predicted effects, it is clear that a more resilient landscape will be imperative if local society are to adapt and respond to the challenges of the future. Robust ecosystems underpin resilience in landscape function. To achieve these, healthy soils, dune recover, better use and conservation of available rainfall, pragmatic use of vegetation and groundcover, and increasing biodiversity are key. \n \nThe necessity of matching structural expressions of ecological integrity with cultural perceptions is particularly highlighted, by reference to the cultural bases for landscape perception and management (Nassauer, 1997), the landscape archetypes (Bell, 1999), and to the concepts of cultural and ecotone landscapes (Farina, 2006). These are examined for their potential role in creating a new synthesis of nature and culture. \nDevelopment of a realistic vision for Systemic Design in a regenerative landscape depends upon understanding the peculiar circumstances of its physical geography and biogeography linked to local history, culture and economic system (Bistagnino, 2011). The regeneration is based on scenarios of potential vegetation and hemerobiotic state of an area (the magnitude of the deviation from the potential natural vegetation caused by human activities, see Eurostat, 2017). The regeneration is also based on integration between Firms, Agricultural and wild habitats in order to reach a Blue Economy approach (Pauli, 2017). \n \nThe Blue economy concepts and the Circular economy agenda, as a set of strategic objectives, offer principles and guidance to identify blue economy potential for Po river Delta and its urban, landscape and coastal processes. \nFollowing systemic design approach, the local economy will be based on: \n• coastal landscape regeneration; \n• production of new materials (paper, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed); \n• increasing resilience to climatic changes, sea level rise; \n• design a new production environment with a Biofactory system integrating food, material and energy production. Proposed system (based on rice, hemp, wood, weeds, and shells) can be developed into a variety of commercial items including chemicals, paper, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed. \n \nAnalysis of the state-of-art and configuration of sustainable development scenarios have been performed by adopting the approach of Geograhical Systemic Design: This allows local solutions to be addressed locally. \n \nWe have also built some project proposals in details: they go in the direction of re-generating agricultural lands. They can be considered as a sort of business model, that means that the benefits by migration from business-as-usual to new ecological based business models has been defined, by given the numbers of economical value outcomes. \nThese are long-term solutions as we wanted to contribute to improve the resilience of the studied area. \nProject proposals are inspired by the Blue Economy and can be summarised as follows: \n \nThe beach dunes and beach areas can be rebuild using only a reshaping of areas and beach management. \nIn the back-dune area the regenerate wetlands (dominated by Phragmites australis) will became a multifunctional ecotope, acting from water depuration to salt intrusion barrier. In this area a regenerative agriculture is also based in aquaculture waste recycling (Morris et al, 2018) is integrated into design of a new ecosystem mosaic: rice (Oryza sativa) – traditional in the Po river Delta agriculture landscape – and hemp cultivation (Cannabis sativa) can be integrated with phramites grooves and willow shrubs. \nA Quercus ilex forests and psammophyl vegetation in coastal areas can be redesigned in rural landscape. The dunes can be built as is mainly due to successional stages linked to it, herbaceous vegetation of grey dunes and mantles using mollusc aquaculture waste (production of calcareous shells from Mytilus galloprovincialis, Venerupis decussata, Tapes philippinarum). \nThe rice and hemp will be integrated with grassland with Vicia faba var. Minor in order to regenerate agriculture and integrate it with pasture activities (Ovis aries). Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) will be growth in new woodlands (Quercus ilex forests). \n \nSome of the benefits of proposed scenarios include: \n• Reduction of flooding and sea storms risks. \n• Effective erosion control. \n• Reduced water consumption. \n• Reduced maintenance costs and increasing local growth economy. \n• Increased natural capital and ecosystem value. \n• Elimination of chemical use. \n• Reduced visual impact of development. \n• Better soil conditions due to the use of native plants. \n \nSoil health can be be built; depletion cannot be rectified by adding chemical elements to address identified symptoms. Carbon is a master variable within soil that controls many processes, such as development of soil structure, water storage and nutrient cycling. Every gram of soil organic carbon can hold up to 8 grams of water. Every regenerated are can increase from 3 to 5 tons of soil organic carbon per hectare.","- Population demands power generation and industrial applications for secure energy due to fulfilling basic requirements. It causes land cover changes; produces destruction of environment, geological resources and biological resources. This impact can be examined by using geospatial applications; remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS). Present review based on the role of geospatial technology in vegetation mapping, biodiversity conservation and land use land cover (LULC) analysis. This review focused on the utility of geospatial technology in vegetation mapping, in an analysis of land use land cover as well as the correlation between land cover change and destruction of biodiversity. However geological resources are the raw material of development, due to mankind cannot admit defeat on it. As per this paper, it is concluded that astute use of geological resources, ecological restoration, urban development planning and eco- friendly substitute and alternatives must provide the answer of sustainable development.","The soil toxicity can be assessed following the growth inhibition of green alga in soil elutriat. UV transformation of organic matter content, like humic acids, PAH compounds, heavy metal according with their oxidative status and water solubility or other unknown substances from soil should be much more toxicants for exposed algas. A descriptive analysis of the susceptibility of different compounds to be converted in the presence of UV radiation, in relation with its ecotoxicity is achieved in this article. A final report of the USEPA (2013) states that the test is of great interest in the following areas: Toxicology, Public Health and Occupational Medicine, Environmental Health and Safety, Environmental and Occupational Factors. Various nonpunctual source pollution (urban, industrial or agricultural) may lead to contamination of the sediment/soil with various toxic substances. The effects of these pollutants can be observed in the short term (e.g. exposure to heavy metals, the chlorophenol) or long term (exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). Determined individually these substances may be present in lower concentrations than the recommended references. In time, however, through their synergistic effect they can reach a sharp deterioration of the environment, manifested by the destruction of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity by alteration the ability of the environment to return to the original characteristics. The application of algal growth inhibition test in soil elutriat is of great interest in assessing the industrial areas contamination (Sbrilli &amp; Batistini 2011). In the soil analysis, this test corresponds with the qualitative assessment of the presence of any toxic substances in soil, sediment or water column above. As we know, the concentrations of persistent toxic substances in the sediments are higher, through their storing, after the sedimentation process. In the water column above, the concentrations are usually much lower because here the toxic substances cannot be stored due to their remobilization and bio-disponibilization. The UV irradiation of environmental samples. The application of UV irradiation in conjunction with the algal growth inhibition test are allowing to obtain effects, with","This special Highlight section of Annals of Botany contains seven papers that show the rapid progress in understanding the genetics related to plant evolution – identifying genes that have immediate effects on reproductive behaviour and diversity, and that directly lead to further diversification and eventually speciation. Understanding the genetic effects and genes that enable these processes is critical for both wild ecosystems and crop species. The study of plant genetics is moving forward at an unprecedented rate: for most of the last century geneticists had a few phenotypes to work with, but by the early 1990s there were hundreds of isozyme and then DNA markers allowing fine mapping of plant genomes in carefully constructed crosses. By the year 2000, with the results from DNA sequencing, there were hundreds of genes known from their DNA and research could move from marker discovery to functional genomics, relating these gene sequences to single-gene, Mendelian phenotypes, some of which have surprising consequences. \n \nFor some years now, both simple characters and groups of genes have been related to complex phenotypes through QTL (quantitative trait locus) analysis, and mutation or transgenic approaches. Taxonomy has continued its development from a descriptive aspect of botanical research to having a strong phylogenetic and evolutionary basis, including DNA sequences to complement morphological analysis. The interpretation of the results from experimental hybridization has also been helpful in defining species and their relationships. However, results from hybridization can be misleading, with many exceptions in both directions to the simplistic concept that two plants that hybridize are the same species. Many characters, ranging from polyploidy to sexual incompatibility, prevent hybrids being made within a species, while otherwise well-defined species form hybrids that are among the most successful and dominant genotypes in many environments, and in some cases become species themselves. As our understanding of genetics has increased, ever more features of plant behaviour have been shown to be under close genetic control; this Highlight brings together seven outstanding articles showing the nature – and range – of genetic effects on speciation and domestication. While most Highlight issues featuring manuscripts on a particular important topic are planned a year or more in advance, these papers were submitted by chance around the same time, and have been published together in this issue to show the rapid advances in the area of understanding genetic effects on divergence and speciation. \n \nThe review by Rieseberg and Blackman (2010) identifies no less than 41 genes that have been considered to lead to reproductive isolation of populations. Interestingly, the genes are very diverse, and include those which have prezygotic and postzygotic effects. Simple geographical isolation is not seen as the only widespread cause of speciation and the cessation of gene flow between populations; nevertheless, both larger and smaller features of geography lead to isolation of populations, and He et al. (2010) are able to show an example where the genetic structure of a species, Banksia hookeriana, is not solely dependent on the structure of a landscape, in this case where the population is located on sand dune crests physically separated by uninhabitable hollows. Occasional long-distance dispersal of seeds or movement of individuals from one population to another maintains connectivity within the species and prevents isolation. In contrast, Nomura et al. (2010) provide insight into the phylogeny and implications of habitat diversity. Farfugium (Asteraceae) is a monophyletic group associated with a wide range of habitats, including forest understorey (sciophytes), coastal crags (heliophytes) and riverbeds (rheophytes) in an archipelago in east Asia. They conclude that isolation on islands and subsequent parallel adaptation events followed migration over Quaternary land-bridges along the distribution range. Uninformative DNA sequence variation coupled with highly divergent morphologies suggest that adaptive diversification was rapid. \n \nThe other four papers make conclusions related to the genetic diversification and selection seen in crop plants. The Tehuacan Valley in Mexico provides a remarkable ‘natural laboratory’ for study of human selection effects on plants, because there are well over 100 native plant species where artificial selection is being practiced and these silvicultural and cultivated populations co-exist with wild populations. Parra et al. (2010) study the cactus Stenocereus puinosus and find that despite selection for larger and sweeter fruit, there are high levels of gene flow that have promoted morphological divergence and moderate genetic structure between wild and managed populations, while conserving genetic diversity. Hence, despite strong selection, there is no evident genetic bottleneck that might limit breeders of the fruit in future, unlike that seen in many other domesticated species. \n \nAs noted above, hybridization or polyploidy – speciation by whole-genome duplication – can lead to new, and reproductively isolated, species in a single event. Evidence of evolutionarily recent polyploidy events is seen in half of all plants, and contributes significantly to plant biodiversity. Shi et al. (2010) look at ancient events, or paleopolyploidy, that may be inferred from genomic data and their analysis of the nuclear genomes of kiwi fruit (Actinidia) and related Ericales shows evidence for at least two paleopolyploidy events. Their results provide evidence that gene-family methods are able to reliably uncover ancient polyploid speciation events. \n \nSoybean, Glycine max, is an important tetraploid crop, but there are still gaps in its domestication history. Guo et al. (2010) carry out an extensive study of the diversity of soybean from its South China centre of origin using molecular markers, and propose a single origin with a moderately severe genetic bottleneck during domestication. Wild soybeans in this region have an unexploited and valuable gene pool for future breeding, but, unlike the situation in Stenocereus, it will require careful study and extensive crossing with selection to introduce this diversity into the germplasm pool available to plant breeders. The final paper in the Highlight presents an important example of how diversity from a wild species can be used in one of the world's three most important grain crops. Rice, Oryza sativa, requires fertilization to set seed, but the temperatures experienced during hot weather (over 32–36 °C) induce sterility. Considering that such temperatures are rarely reached in the early morning, Ishimaru et al. (2010) introgressed an early-morning flowering (EMF) trait from wild rice, O. officinalis, where anthesis occurs soon after sunrise. Although the temperature effect on sterility itself was similar in the two rice species, the avoidance of high temperatures by a few hours caused by the early-morning flowering trait leads to significantly increased fertility in the line with introgression of the EMF trait. \n \nTogether, these seven papers add considerably to our understanding of genetics in a broad evolutionary context. The results are of significance for wild species, with implications for whole ecosystems, and indeed the species used as examples in these papers are those of coastal, island and duneland systems that are particularly threatened by changes including urban ‘development’, sea-level alterations, storm frequencies and temperature. The crop papers show how knowledge of the mechanisms of evolution and associated genes can impact on our exploitation of biodiversity in crops and their wild relatives.","Biodiversity is an essential component of nature, relegating the aspects of geodiversity, which provides geological and landscape variety to a territory. However, the importance of geodiversity and its social, economic, educational, scientific, and technological impact on a region, are not well understood. This article measures the geoheritage values of Guayaquil, a port city in Ecuador, via surveys and analyses of variables, with the aim of proposing guidelines or strategies that promote the knowledge and diffusion of that geoheritage. Our methodology included (i) a review of historical landmarks of Guayaquil and their relationship with geodiversity, (ii) a survey and data tabulation, (iii) an analysis of the local population’s perception of the city’s geoheritage, and (iv) the development of geodiversity strategies using computer tools. Our results determined that people approach areas of interest because of each site’s biodiversity and the available information about the site. Once there, they can obtain knowledge about the city’s geology, geodiversity, and urban geotourism. Therefore, geoheritage is an essential consideration in establishing educational plans, initiatives, and promotion strategies. Furthermore, the identification of a city’s heritage values following geoeducation, and the recognition by society of the city’s geosites and their historical–scientific significance, will provide a basis for using geotourism in a context of sustainability.","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emerging from the Rio Earth Summit provided substantial synergy on environmental management. Kenya in her Vision 2030 agenda prioritized implementation of SDGs. This paper documents the evidence for the process of implementation of SDGs in Nairobi through adoption of green concept in environmental management. The emphasis is on the SDGs that are dependent on protected, conserved and preserved environment. Data was collected by surveying 92 households and five key informants (n=97) using semi-structured questionnaires, interviews and observations. The non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to determine the degree of connectivity between the process of implementation of SDGs and adoption of the green concept in environmental management. The respondents’ knowledge, attitudes and practice on implementation of SDGs through green concept in environmental management was significantly low. About sixty percent thought SDG 1 would be enhanced through attributes that protect the environment while attributed implementation of SDG 3.9 would be implemented through preserved environment. Again majority of them perceived SDG 7 would be implemented through use of clean energy devices. However, it’s only the minority that thought SDG 13 would be implemented through conservation of the environment. Majority of respondents were of the views that increased awareness, improved institutional capacity, enhanced enforcement, and individual aptness would enhance implementation of the SDGs through adoption of green concept in environmental management. *Corresponding Author: Mutembei Henry M’ikiugu  hmutembei@uonbi.ac.ke Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 1-10, 2018 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2018 2 | Eva and M’ikiugu Introduction The United Nations Assembly adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Sustainable Development (CGAP report, 2016). There are 17 goals within the SDGs framework (Fig. 1). The SDGs serve as milestones and benchmarks for achieving sustainable development with measurable targets and clear-cut timetables (UN report, 2000; CGAP, 2016). Amongst the issues addressed by implementation of SDGs are inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, weak institutional capacity, and environmental degradation. Implementation of SDGs is also expected to halt human activities threatening the environment through increased biodiversity loss, water scarcity, pollution, and climate change (UNEP report, 2012). Environmental goods and services support economic and social development. Thus, the sustainability of the environment’s viability in urban cities like Nairobi it is essential fully implement SDGs through protection, preservation and conservation of the environment (green concept) (Sterner, 2006). Once the environmental resources and services are taken care of through adoption of the green concept, the resultant value would be a great impact on sustainable implementation of the related SDGs (Steiner, 2006). Thus, SDGs that include goal 1 (end poverty), which requires both the provision of basic income and social protection through wealth creation and distribution would be implemented (Mosse, 2010). In addition goal 3.9 (reducing deaths and illnesses from pollution) and goal 7 (ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy) will also be guaranteed through adoption of green concept in environmental management) (Ren21 report, 2014; UN report, 2014). The main SDG (Goal 13: Take Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change and Its Impacts) that is the centre of global focus in economies, societies and environmental resource sustainability could benefit substantially through adoption of green concept in environmental management (Maslin, 2009; PMA report, 2015). One approach muted for sustainable implementation SDGs through adoption of green concept is international participatory via collaborative involvement of public and private sectors, and civil societies (IPCC report, 2007; Bausch, 2011). However, the smooth implementation of SDGs in countries require constant monitoring through evidence gathering to inform policy for necessary shifts to be undertaken from time to time within the implantation time frame (Survey of Kenya report, 2003; KabuboMariara, 2007; KFSSG report, 2008; USAID report, 2008). This so because a number of social and political factors continue to put pressure on natural resources and could easily compromise on the sustainable implementation of SDGs in countries like Kenya (UNDP report, 2005). This paper seeks to provide evidence on factors that affect implementation of SDGs in Nairobi through adoption of the green concept in order to inform policy for appropriate action plan for sustainability. Materials and methods The theoretical framework of the research (Fig. 2) was based on institutional and resource based view where coercive push and resource benefits for society are expected to influence adoption of green concept in environmental management (Florida and Davison, 2001). In brief the design the study that assumed that adopt the green concept in environmental management would enhance the implementation of SDGs that depend on environmental resources and services (SDGs 1, 3.9, 7, and 13). Data was collected from Nairobi. Surveys were conducted using semistructured questionnaires and key informant interviews. The questionnaires and interviews focused on attributes on implementation of SDGs through adoption of green concept in environmental management (activities of conservation, preservation and protection of the environment). Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method was used to evaluate the determinants of implementation of SDGs as affected by respondents’ perceptions, knowledge, J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2018 3 | Eva and M’ikiugu attitudes and practices in environmental management (Reinhard et al., 2000; De Koeijer et al., 2002; Sipiläinen et al., 2008). Briefly, the DEA method compared various individual and institutional decisions for adoption of the green concept as they impacted on the implementation of SDGs, as also evaluated by others (Boussonfiane et al., 1991; De Koeijer et al., 2002). The analysis aimed to determine how individual and institutional decisions on adaption of green concept affected implementation of SDGs 1, 3.9, 7 and 13 (Solovyeva et al., 2011). The possible theories of statistical variety on each decision type of the randomly chosen respondents were applied in the analysis of the data (MacDonald et al., 2000, Tasser and Tappeiner, 2002; Dullinger et al., 2003, Fare and Grosskopf, 2004; Kuosmanen and Kortelainen, 2004 and 2005; Kuemmerle et al., 2008). Ninety two (92) household heads were surveyed and five (5) key informants interviewed. Open and closed questions as well as qualitative and quantitative questions were used (Jahnke and Jahnke, 1982; Fare and Grosskopf, 2004). The indicators were weighed according to their importance in the implementation of the said SDGs through adoption of green concept in environmental management. Chi-square was used to test of significance (P≤0.05, n=97). Statistical (social desirability bias and leniency bias) was minimized by adapting previously described methods (Michelsen and de Boer, 2009).","Through analysis on the theory and method which are used in evaluating the ecological status at home and broad synthetically,the quantitative method-Ecological Comprehensive Index(ECI)-for evaluating the ecological status according to China's actual conditions is put forward.The method can be used to judge quantitatively and comprehensively in which stage China's ecological restoration and destruction is.Combining the actual condition of Chinese ecological restoration,this paper built an indicator system for ECI considering the hierarchy,systematicness,realism and importance.The indicators of ECI include eight aspects:the status of forest,desert,soil erosion,biodiversity,wetland,grassland,cropland and urban ecological conditions.The calculation of ECI is divided into general index formula,first level index formula and second level index formula,which belongs to the Analytic Hierarchy Process method with well arranged hierarchy and giving prominence to the key points.The ECI has three domains of ECI1,ECI=1(±0.05),and ECI1.Through calculating,the ECI of China is 1.02,which is in the domain of ECI=1(±0.05),and the ecological status in ecological restoration and destruction is at a stalemate.Therefore,China must carry on large-scale ecological restoration to benign development of system.The application of ECI to the judgement of the ecological status of China is of great significance in guiding the country's ecological restoration in theory and practice.","Preface Annual Review of Resource Economics Vol. 1 DOI: 10.1146/annurev.re.1.090409.100001 Gordon Rausser, Kerry Smith, and David Zilberman FULL-TEXT| | Permissions | Reprints Citation: Web of Science ®| Download| Email notification| The Annual Review of Resource Economics is being launched simultaneously with the new Annual Review of Economics and the Annual Review of Financial Economics. The purpose of all of these Reviews is to provide authoritative critical reviews evaluating the most significant research developments in each field. The groundbreaking Annual Review of Resource Economics will provide a forum in which emerging and leading scholars will evaluate the most important contemporary advances in the broad field of resource economics, focusing on agricultural economics, environmental economics, renewable resources, exhaustible resources, and economic development. Scholars authoring articles in each volume will lay out the most important recent developments based on the significant findings contributing to the total literature in the field, writing with technical precision for a broad audience of scholars across the economics and related disciplines. Our strategy in commissioning these articles is different from other reviews. We deliberately target research frontier questions—where different methodologies are available to address closely related problems or where different results have coexisted without efforts to reconcile them. Each volume is designed for audiences with a general background in economics as well as a broad range of scientists interested in the core of analytical economics, the natural sciences, and public policy. In the final analysis, it is the intention of the editorial committee of the Annual Review of Resource Economics to present in each volume a rolling textbook or desk reference for all those professionals seeking authoritative, peer-reviewed, and up-to-date analysis on the nexus between resource economics, natural science, and public policy. In this first volume of the Annual Review of Resource Economics, we have organized the contributions around four broad themes: policy analysis and design (nine articles), resource dynamics (seven articles), ecology and space (six articles), and technology and innovation (six articles). Within each of these categories, the articles are sequenced to move from the more general to the more specific. In the policy analysis and design category, the articles begin with the broad picture of the role of agriculture in economic development. They then continue with the economics of transition in developing economies; global distortions in economic sectors resulting from governmental intervention; financial contracts between the public and private sectors; environmental regulations and their influence on market structure; the development of new risk markers; policy reactions to the so-called curse of natural resources; experimental economics analysis of the intersection of the environment and development; and finally, the evaluation of designed experiments on choice behavior, the environment, and health in developing countries. The resource dynamics category begins with analyses of irreversibility, a current assessment of the seminal work of Hotelling and the intertemporal modeling of risk and uncertainty. It continues with an overview of rent taxation for exhaustible resources, assessments of the interaction between climate change and both land use and urban growth, and ends with a comparison of reduced-form and structural modeling in environmental and resource economics. In the third category (ecology and space), issues of land use, water allocation, and biodiversity are assessed, beginning with the integration of ecological and economic models, our progress on land use, endangered species, and water allocation and pricing. The final category on technology and innovation is initiated with an authoritative assessment of the economics of RD energy efficiency economics; and recent developments in renewable technologies, biofuels, and biotechnology.","There is an increasing need for humans to address anthropogenic changes such as deforestation, eutrophication, and water pollution in our ecosystems. Using a geochemical tool like stable isotopes helps us better understand how humans affect lacustrine environments and determine specifically where we must facilitate management strategies for restoring biodiversity and essential ecosystem services lost due to human activity in the biosphere. Stable isotopes preserved in lacustrine sediments are one such way to reconstruct the environmental history of a region. Here, we use stable isotope analysis from temperate lakes in Wisconsin to highlight paleolimnological changes in response to increasing stress due to human activity. Several changes in the biogeochemical cycle have occurred due to cultural eutrophication in Shadow Lake for example, such as decreased oxygen and increased heavy metal concentrations. We measured C/C and O/O ratios of organic and inorganic C (calcite) in the core sediments to infer decadal trends in nutrient loading and primary production at these sites. We hypothesize that the changes in dC values are linked to increased nutrient loading and eutrophication from agricultural and urban development of the area. Changes in dO values point to disruption of thermal stratification in the lakes and suggests a link to sudden climatic changes or water circulation disruptions in the last century. These changes indicate that ecological stresses of anthropogenic origin warrant renewed management strategies that can return lacustrine environments to their natural state. INTRODUCTION Humans have become the principal agents of environmental and biotic change on Earth. There is an increasing need to address anthropogenic changes such as deforestation, eutrophication, and water pollution in our ecosystems. By assessing geohistorical records, we can reconstruct the environmental history of a region, identify ecological thresholds that provide evidence of past or approaching ecological collapse in a lacustrine environment, and respond to those changes with appropriate recovery management solutions. The use of paleoecological techniques to assess recent Holocene environmental changes plays an important role in monitoring and preserving human impacted lacustrine habitats because it provides us with a longterm perspective of ecological changes outside the timescale of direct human observation (Froyd &amp; Willis 2008). Here we focus on isotopic analysis of lacustrine sediments to track anthropogenic influences on temperate lakes in Wisconsin. This method has been used by others to reconstruct disturbances to the biogeochemical cycle in lacustrine environments (Schelske and Hodell 1991). We hope to construct an environmental history of three temperate lakes in Wisconsin, USA, as a means of improving remediation efforts for lacustrine ecosystems. A multi-proxy approach of assessing the quality of lacustrine environments generates useful data for understanding how anthropogenic activity affects Wisconsin lakes (Froyd and Willis 2008). Stable isotope geochemistry is one such proxy that has been 30th Annual Symposium Volume, 29th April, 2017 2 used as a paleoclimate reconstruction tool since Urey et. al (1951) described oxygen isotope compositions as a potential method of paleotemperature reconstruction. Carbon and oxygen isotopes are widely used proxies for reconstructing the environmental history of an ecosystem. Carbon is widely available in both organic and inorganic substances in lakes. This paper focuses on carbon isotope ratios derived from calcite; the distinction between C isotope ratios of organic carbon and inorganic carbon is important because isotope signatures of dissolved organic carbon and calcite vary greatly (Sadurski 2012). Two stable isotopes of carbon exist in nature, C and C, although C makes up most of the carbon on Earth (only 1‰ is C). Carbon isotope fractionation in lake systems occurs normally due to thermodynamic processes of the mineral precipitation reaction of calcite. ∂O variations in calcite are typically attributed to changes in temperature or ratio of precipitation to evaporation in a lake system (Leng and Marshall 2004). Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of lacustrine carbonates is a readily-employed technique in paleolimnology, and isotopic relationships of paleoenvironmental significance are discussed in this paper.","Given the current status of political discussion in Europe about raw materials problems, the sustainable development of the extractive industry and the reduction of its environmental footprint is among the key topics in this discussion. In this context, the European Commission approved the EO-MINERS project (Earth Observation for Monitoring and Observing Environmental and Societal Impacts of Mineral Resources Exploration and Exploitation). One of the scientific and technical objectives of EO-MINERS is to assess policy requirements at macro (public) and micro (mining companies) levels and define environmental, socioeconomic, societal and sustainable development criteria and indicators to be possibly dealt using earth observation (EO) technologies. Further to that, the project will use existing EO knowledge and carry out new developments on three demonstration sites (Sokolov lignite mining area, Czech Republic, Witbank coal field, South Africa, Kumtor gold mine, Kyrgyzstan) to further demonstrate the capabilities of integrated EO-based methods and tools in monitoring, managing and contributing reducing the environmental and societal footprints of the extractive industry during all phases of a mining project, from the exploration to the exploitation and closure stages. Finally, it will contribute providing reliable and objective information about affected ecosystems, populations and societies, to serve as a basis for a sound “trialogue” between industrialists, governmental organisations and stakeholders. INTRODUCTION Mining and extractive industry have played a significant role in the development of many countries all over the world. The industry has been, and continues to be an important contributor to both national and regional economies and is critical to national defence. Mining, and the industries it supports, is among the basin building blocks of a modern society. The world today is facing and increasing mineral resource demand. This has been illustrated by the European Commission Vice President Günter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, who said: \"European industries need predictability in the flow of raw materials and stable prices to remain competitive. We are committed to improve the conditions of access to raw materials, be it within Europe or by creating a level playing field in accessing such materials from abroad”. In recent years, the EU’s total material requirement has remained at a constantly high level – roughly 50 tonnes a year per head of the population since the middle of the 1980s. But in this time the weight of imports and their environmental impacts have considerably increased (EEA 2003). The bulk of this increase is attributable to ores, mineral fuels, metalware and products such as glass, ceramics and precious stones. These four categories account for most of the ecological impact of imports. More than half of these originate in the developing countries, while fewer resources are extracted in Europe itself. Numerous mines have closed in Europe during the last few decades, either because of natural exhaustion or because they were not profitable. With the closure of mines environmental pressure has been reduced in Europe but risen in other regions. The environmental footprint of EU material consumption has shifted from Europe to other regions. At the same time, the ecological impacts of imports into the EU have increased. One tonne of imports leaves behind an average amount of 5 tonnes in mining waste, emissions and erosion in the exporting country (Schütz/Moll/Bringezu 2003). This ratio has more than doubled over the past twenty-five years, and in the case of ores has quadrupled from 1:4 to 1:16 tonnes. This suggests that the acquisition of raw materials is becoming more and more costly, that more energy has to be used, and that more waste is left behind by mining operations. The analysis of the ecological impacts of imports to the EU reveals that environmental burden are shifted with significant social and economic consequences in other parts of the world. The global dimension of this problem is being increasingly recognized. Access to raw materials was on the agenda of the G8 Summit on 6-8 June 2007. On that occasion a Declaration on \"Responsibility for raw materials: transparency and sustainable growth\" was adopted, which addresses the key priorities for a sustainable and transparent approach to this question. In addition, the Competitiveness Council meeting on 21 May 2007 has invited the Commission to develop a coherent political approach to the issues arising. As a result, the European Commission launched in autumn 2008 ”The Raw Materials Initiative – Meeting our Critical Needs for Growth and Jobs in Europe” (COM(2008)699). The exploitation of natural resources in many developing countries has been considered as a vital part of economic growth, employment and infrastructure development, but it has come at a cost to the environment. Early mining operations have left a historical legacy of negative environmental impacts that affect our perception of mining. With the emergence of the concept of sustainable development, it is now recognised that environmental protection is as fundamental to a healthy economy and society as it is development. The challenge is to simultaneously promote both economic growth and environmental protection. The responsible management of Earth’s environment is one of today’s most pressing concerns and a central motivation for the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). Sound environmental management of mining activities can avoid high remediation costs, which frequently might drain public funds. Surface and groundwater pollution, soil contamination, and terrain instability all cause damage that can affect urban and sub-urban areas. Understanding and monitoring pollution processes in mining areas is therefore of concern to a very wide user community, including central government bodies or agencies, local authorities, industry, environmental groups and individual citizens. Facing legal and social pressures, also the mining industry is interested to minimize the impacts on environment and society. Formerly due to often accumulating remediation costs, nowadays these activities play an important role at the stock market and an increasing environmental awareness is an essential aspect of modern mining management. But the technology platform to support such critical environmental monitoring is diverse, geographically inconsistent, site specific, lacks integration across technologies and is therefore far from complete. Understandably, it is currently a gap within GEO’s Global Earth Observing System of Systems, which concentrates on issues such as Disasters and Climate Change. The non-energy extractive industry (NEEI) of the EU-25 generated a direct turnover of about €40 billion, and provided employment to about 250,000 people in 16,629 enterprises in 2004 (SEC(2007)771). Estimated indirect employment provided by NEEI industry is up to 4 times greater than the directly employed, and is clearly a significant contributor to the economy of the EU. The use of these primary raw materials in the products of other branches of EU industry means they have a central role in guaranteeing industrial and economic sustainability. Nevertheless current demand exceeds production, and so the EU is heavily dependent on mineral and metal imports leading to an annual trade deficit of about €11 billion (SEC(2007)771). Metallic minerals accounted for 90% of this deficit (€10 billion), while there were also net trade deficits in construction minerals (€456 million) and industrial minerals (€798 million). Several national and international initiatives, both from the private or the institutional sectors, have been developed to address the sustainable development of the extractive industry and the reduction of the environmental footprint. One can cite:  Both the EU’s 2001 Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) (renewed in 2006) and the 2005 Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources aim at a decoupling of economic activity from environmental impacts by considering the entire life cycle of resource use. This means that environmental impacts are considered at each stage of the life-cycle of the product and the raw materials – during extraction, transport, processing/refining, the use phase of the products made from it, and when a product or raw material becomes waste at the end of its useful life – thus avoiding negative impacts being shifted to other environmental media, to other stages of the life-cycle, or to other countries.  The ETP-SMR Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). The Implementation Plan (IP) focuses on ways and means to implement the most urgent activities outlined in the SRA. In particular the short Term Research Priority 8 mentions “Helping cities in mining regions secure their strategic land, water and biodiversity resources by the use of modelling and economic tools”.  ICMM (International Council on Mining and Metals) members have committed to the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework. The Sustainable Development Framework comprises three elements and a set of 10 Principles (including a set of supporting position statements), public reporting and independent assurance. The Framework has been developed systematically since the formation of ICMM in 2001, with its foundations in the Mining, Minerals, and Sustainable Development (MMSD) project.  The SDIMI, an international forum for the Sustainable Development indicators in the Mineral Industry, which objective is to assist the mining and minerals industries in their global transition to sustainable development. SDIMI states that “Meeting the development needs of the world’s growing population without depriving future generations of the means to meet their own needs, better known as Sustainable Development is the key challenge facing the minerals and mining industry. At present, a special focus ","The expansion of urban areas leads the loss of green spaces causing many environmental and economic problems. The infrastructure has been carried to the rural areas to deal with the needs of populations, reducing the green vegetation. This isolates one habitat area from other habitats and increases the fragmentation. A green corridor can connect fragmented habitats. Thus, this research aims to analyze and provide a green corridor in four different cities of Jordan. Through study some case studies, review of articles, researches, data collection, GIS, observations and maps derived from Jordanian ministries were used for the analysis of a green corridor in four cities in the northwest of Jordan. This research provides a comprehensive planning of the biogeographically areas, ecotourism sites and variety of vegetation in the protected areas of namely, Ajloun Forest Reserve and Dibben Forest Reserve, to link them in the biodiversity and conservation regions of the Al-Salt and north Amman, after identifying these diverse areas of vegetation cover and wildlife in each governorate. In addition, the research discusses ecological, environmental and economic effects of applying a green corridor as a sustainable city approach in Jordan. In other words, the purpose of this study is to suggest a sustainable proposal by analyzing green area zones and green corridor axes to improve the nature and the environment in Jordan. This proposal adapts urban areas with the establishment of green corridor connecting conservation areas in Jerash and Ajloun to Al-Salt and north of Amman. Such a green corridor can lead an increase of local and international tourism which may improve the economic strength and can increase the job opportunities for citizens to live in a more ecological urban environment. Keywords: Environmental sustainability; green corridor; connectivity; planning; Jordan","Landscape modification, especially those human-dominated changes, has been widely considered as one of the key drivers inducing the degradation of environment and ecosystem. The consequent habitat loss and fragmentation, which are closely related to ecological process, have attracted much scholarly attention. However, very few studies have systematically examined their causes and consequences at the landscape level. Integrating human activities into consideration in a holistic way remains poorly understood in particular. This thesis reports a systematic study of habitat loss and fragmentation under urbanization. This research distinguishes itself from previous works in its investigation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of causes and consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation, and its endeavor to disentangle habitat fragmentation from simple habitat loss in terms of their processes and effects. The Shenzhen River cross-border watershed, shared by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Shenzhen, is used as a case to illustrate how these ideas can work in practice. The study period spans from 1988 to 2008.The main contents of the study include analysis of the processes and causes of habitat loss and fragmentation, and dynamic consequences on water quality and ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation at spatial and temporal scales. Various methods are employed, mainly including conventional and newly developed landscape metrics (such as the Urbanization Isolation Effect (UIE) and Habitat Isolation Degree (HID)), a spatial statistical approach based on the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, spatio-temporal analyses and cross-border comparison. Major findings of the research are highlighted as follows. First, habitat loss and fragmentation show great spatial heterogeneity as well as temporal variation due to extensive and rapid urban sprawl in the study area. Second, by adopting the GWR model, it is found that human-related factors have played a significant role in determining not only the “amount” but also the “location” of habitat loss. Third, by using two new landscape metrics, namely the UIE and HID, both the extent (urban sprawl) and intensity (population density) of urbanization are suggested to have significant influences in habitat isolation. Fourth, water quality in the watershed is recognized to be closely correlated with habitat loss and fragmentation, and the correlations show major discrepancies between the Hong Kong and the Shenzhen sides. Moreover, by proposing a compound indicator (NP/MPS) for measuring habitat fragmentation (independent of simple habitat loss), it is found that habitat loss has exerted a bigger influence on water quality degradation than habitat fragmentation. Fifth, by integrating habitat connectivity into the evaluation of ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation, both the habitat size and connectivity are recognized to be important in explaining the degradation of ecosystem services value. Habitat size has played a dominant role in the overall change of ecosystem services value, whereas the role of connectivity (fragmentation) is more critical when the “stepping stones” sites are lost. The study provides a new framework to examine the habitat loss and fragmentation under urbanization at the landscape level. The efforts show great effectiveness in providing sound and useful information for future landscape planning, biodiversity conservation and watershed management.","The spider infraorder Mygalomorphae includes the funnel-web spiders, tarantulas, trapdoor spiders and their kin. Because of their particular life history characteristics, systematic revisions of mygalomorph taxa are fundamentally informative and of broader biological interest, but also a matter of conservation priority. Mygalomorph spiders are relatively long-lived, usually with limited dispersal abilities, high habitat specificity, and a long historical presence in areas relative to landscape processes. These characteristics lead to high levels of speciation and local endemism in many mygalomorph lineages, and a build-up of genetic structure between and within species at fine spatial scales. From the perspective of a researcher, high levels of genetic structure and speciation make mygalomorph lineages ideal for investigating biogeographic history and speciation processes. From a conservation perspective, local endemism, habitat specificity and low dispersal ability mean that mygalomorph populations (and potentially species) are sensitive to habitat modification, and have little ability to disperse from, or recolonise, affected areas. In the context of a biodiversity crisis, and hindered by ‘impediments’ to systematics and taxonomy, systematists must allocate their time and efforts carefully. Given their inherent vulnerability and the value of research on mygalomorph taxa, revisions of poorly known elements of this fauna are both urgent and of evolutionary importance.\nIntergeneric relationships within the spiny trapdoor spiders of Australasia (Idiopidae: Arbanitinae) were recently stabilised. This provided a foundation for targeted work into genera within the subfamily, many of which had never received substantial systematic attention. Prior to my project, only seven species of golden trapdoor spider (tribe Euoplini, previously all in the genus Euoplos) had been described from eastern Australia, despite the genus spanning the length and breadth of the eastern mesic zone. The genus was seen as a conservation priority because it is highly diverse in south-eastern Queensland, Australia, a region where urban development (sub-coastal) and agricultural development (inland) threaten to encroach on the natural remnants where undescribed species occur. Furthermore, undocumented variability in morphology and burrow entrance structure in the genus presented a valuable opportunity to study morphology and behavioural evolution in mygalomorph spiders.\nIn this thesis, I compare and integrate morphological data, behavioural data (burrow entrance type) and molecular data in order to: infer the first robust phylogeny of the genus Euoplos; investigate the phylogenetic signal of morphology and burrow entrance architecture to generate evolutionary hypotheses of broader relevance to mygalomorph systematics; and revise select lineages in the genus based on their conservation priority.\nIn Chapter 2, I use morphological data to guide targeted sampling of Euoplos from eastern Australia, before generating the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny for the genus. Male morphology and burrow entrance architecture are then compared with the molecular phylogeny to reveal the existence of two widespread, sympatric lineages which differ in their burrow entrance structure and male morphology: the ‘wafer-door’ lineage and the ‘plug-door/palisade’ lineage. I also identify a taxonomic error in the literature, where males belonging to a wafer-door species were incorrectly linked with females belonging to a sympatric species in the plug-door/palisade lineage.\nIn chapter 3, I present a systematic revision of a group of Euoplos which were recovered as a clade in Chapter 2, and which construct remarkable ‘palisade’ type burrow entrances. Revision of the group was seen as urgent because all species have very small natural ranges and occur in remnant rainforest habitats within heavily modified landscapes. This revision results in the description of four new species, and I was also able to identify species-specific differences in burrow entrance architecture, providing a means of non-intrusive species identification.\nIn Chapter 4, all available data are integrated into a total-evidence phylogenetic analysis of the entire tribe Euoplini. Ancestral state reconstruction is used to demonstrate how morphological and behavioural (burrow entrance architecture) characters relate to topology. This chapter results in the reclassification of the tribe, with two new genera erected: Cryptoforis (wafer-door lineage) and Narellea (a single, divergent species). This chapter also highlights the utility of both male and female morphology for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies on mygalomorph spiders, and provides morphological characters and a phylogenetic framework for future integrative phylogenetics/taxonomy on the Idiopidae and other mygalomorph groups.\nChapter 5 consists of a complete taxonomic synopsis of the newly-recognised genus Cryptoforis. Revision of this new genus was seen as a priority due to the cryptic nature of the wafer-door burrows they create, and due to the fact that they were previously undocumented from mainland Australia. Numerous species also appear to be short-range endemics, restricted to remnant or relictual habitats in eastern Australia. In total, 16 species are described in the genus.\nIn summary, my project is a comprehensive systematic treatment of the golden trapdoor spiders (tribe Euoplini) of Australia, revealing a diverse assemblage of mygalomorph spiders in multiple evolutionary lineages. It presents new data on phylogenetic relationships, morphology, and behaviour in the tribe. Immediate practical outcomes include a new generic classification of the tribe which more accurately represents the diversity contained within it, a full revision of the new genus Cryptoforis, and a targeted revision of the short-range endemic palisade-building Euoplos from south-eastern Queensland. My thesis demonstrates the strength of a ‘holistic’ total-evidence systematic approach, whereby different data types are iteratively compared and integrated, and in particular, the utility of this approach to understanding the taxonomy and evolution of poorly known mygalomorph taxa.","Urbanisation is a dominant demographic trend and an important component of the earth’s global transformation. It has unprecedented socioeconomic, cultural and environmental implications, and poses a threat to the conservation of biodiversity, as it can provoke alterations in ecological systems and lead to poor functioning of urban systems as they are currently structured. From the ecological point of view, the city is a fragmented, heterogeneous, complex mosaic of habitats, including ecosystems with different degrees of alteration. Urban systems contain only small areas of fragments of original vegetation and/or artificial green spaces, leading to a drastic decrease from their original abundance and diversity. However, green spaces, including original fragments, can help to conserve bird diversity, improving the functioning of these artificial systems in the medium term. This study looks at the characteristics and benefits of urban ecology in the framework of sustainable development, and carries out a meta-analysis of research into bird diversity in four cities in southern Chile, using ecological indices (Shannon-Wiener, β diversity between cities). The results reveal that there is low evenness in the four cities and that the city with the highest evenness is Valdivia (J = 0.78). There is clear dominance by a few bird species (e.g. the exotic species house sparrow Passer domesticus and rock pigeon Columba livia, and the native species rufous-collared sparrow Zonotricia capensis, austral thrush Turdus falklandii, southern lapwing Vanellus chilensis, and chimango caracara Milvago chimango). β diversity is low as the four cities show similarity greater than 50%. Birds reject paved surfaces in squares and prefer areas with native bushes and trees, with nearby bodies of water and large spaces (parks rather than squares). The study proposes technical recommendations and suggests further research.","The practice of environmentally benign agents in the treatment of water is rapidly gaining interest due to their naturally renewable and available character and low harmfulness. Common Mexican cactus produces a gum-like substance, cactus mucilage, which shows excellent flocculating abilities and is an economically viable alternative for low-income communities. Mucilage of Opuntia ficus indica was used as a flocculating agent for heavy metals like Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu) and Chromium (Cr). Biosorption experiment was conducted using two types of treatments i.e. Dice-Cut-Pressed (DCP) cactus treatment and Extracted Mucilage Treatment (EMT). Results showed the mucilage efficiency for adsorbing heavy metals like Pb, Cd, Cu and Ni from wastewater as determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Nickel and Zn concentration was reduced by 72-77% with both DCP and EMT treatments. The Reduction (%) in Pb was higher than Ni and Zn, i.e., 90% with both extractants. Cd and Cu sorption was almost 100% by both the treatments. When quality of treated and untreated waste water effluent was compared with WHO (World Health Organization) standards for irrigation, treated waste water was found to be nearly fit for the irrigation. Results indicate that both the materials can potentially be used as sorbent for chemical pollutants. *Corresponding Author: Asmat Un Nisa  asmat277@gmail.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 10, No. 2, p. 16-24, 2017 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 17 | Hassan et al. Introduction We are living in a period of history where the communal heritage of humanity and the earth is under systemic obstruction. Everything is for sale according to the current model of globalization. Fresh water dramatizes the crisis of the commons more clearly than nothing. Freshwater shortages combined with deeply inequitable access and increased waste water production poses the greatest environmental and human rights threats of our time. Such scenario makes the reuse of wastewater a needy application. Currently, about 80% of urban wastewater is used for irrigation in developing countries that contributes to the 70-80% food security and the livelihoods of urban and peri-urban communities (Mara and Cairncross, 1989 and Cooper, 1991). The untreated wastewater is a rich source of pollutants particularly heavy metals. Continuous application contaminates the soil and hence crop produced. Prolong exposure of men and animals to contaminated products can cause serious health hazards. Pakistan is basically an agriculture country, where water consumption for irrigation is 90% of the total water. Unfortunately, while Pakistan is blessed with groundwater and surface water resources, with the passage of time hasty population growth, urbanization and unmaintainable water consumption practices in the industrial and agricultural sectors have placed immense stress on the quality as well as quantity of water resources in the country (WWF, 2007). The economy of entire population depends on the water of river Indus system, mostly derived from the snowmelt of western Himalayas. Bioremediation is an umbrella term for technologies based on living (or once-living) organisms. One way to of treatment is to use plant extractants that have coagulating properties. These extractants are natural coagulants that can clean water by acting as a flocculating agent. Prickly pear cactus is already tested for its coagulating properties in drinking water samples by adding bacteria and other contaminants. It was found that cactus produces gum-like mucilage that can adhere with certain metals like Arsenic, Nickle and Chromium present in drinking water samples. Similarly bacteria (Bacillus cereus) can also adsorb to the mucilage resulting in water purification. So to meet the idea of waste water reuse, this study was designed for industrial and municipal sewage effluent biotreatment. In this study, industrial/ municipal sewage effluent was given mucilage treatment to check its remedial efficiency. Treated and untreated waste water samples were periodically analyzed for a period of 9 days for heavy metals like Manganese (Mn), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn) and Nickle (Ni). Heavy metals analysis was used to determine the quality of treated wastewater to see its suitability for irrigation purpose and to check the percentage remediation by Prickly pear cactus mucilage. Moreover the degree of treatment was determined and treated wastewater quality parameters were compared with WHO (World Health Organization) standards for agriculture. The present study was performed with the objectives to bio-remediate the industrial and municipal sewage effluent for irrigation purpose. Moreover to compare remedial efficiency of Dice-CutPressed (DCP) cactus treatment and Extracted Mucilage treatment (EMT), and to check the efficacy of DCP and EMT treatments at different time period. Materials and methods The research was conducted at Soil Environment and Soil Fertility laboratory at Land Resources Institute, National Agriculture Research Centre, NARC, Islamabad and Microbiology laboratory at Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Islamabad. Bioremediation of heavy metal rich industrial/municipal sewage effluent was carried out using mucilage of Prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica). Prickly pear cactus collection from field Pads of Prickly pear cactus were collected from the field located in NARC. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 18 | Hassan et al. The extraction of mucilage of Opuntia ficus indica for biosorption Cactus pads were first washed with water and dried. It was next followed by removing spines and peeling of pads. Half of the pads were used for dicing purpose and half of them were used for mucilage extraction by boiling in water. Mucilage extraction by Dice-Cut-Press (DCP) method Peeled pads of Prickly pear cactus were cut into small pieces of about 5cm2 for better mucilage extraction. It was then diced using knife in order to expose the parenchymatous cells which secrete mucilage. Further cactus pieces were pressed with spoon to expose mucilage. The material was then stored at 4oC in refrigerator until use (Fox, 2011). Mucilage extraction in water (Extracted Mucilage Treatment) In EMT method, 6kg of cactus pads were cut into small pieces followed by their cooking in 5 liters of water for 30 minutes. The soluble sugars of mucilage get release into water. Material was then decanted and stored at 4oC in refrigerator until use. Sewage effluent sample collection 100 liters of industrial/municipal sewage effluent sample was brought from Gujranwala (industrial estate) for biotreatment purpose, using mucilage of Opuntia ficus indica. Industries included cottage, steel, marble, confectionary and sanitary industries. Bioremediation of sewage effluent An in-vitro experiment was conducted to evaluate the bio-remedial efficiency of Prickly pear cactus mucilage. The collected effluent was poured in three sets of plastic containers (8L capacity). All three sets were in triplicate. One set of containers was treated with mucilage extracted by DCP method. Second set of containers was treated with water extracted mucilage. While third set of containers was kept control i.e. it was plain sewage water. Each container was filled with 7 liters of sewage effluent sample. In the first set of container, 1.5kg each of diced cactus was added, while in the second set of container, 1.5L each of water extracted mucilage was added for bio-treatment purpose. The third set of containers was kept control. After the addition of biomaterial, the system was left for 10-15 minutes to settle. It was then followed by the withdrawal of 200ml of sample in autoclaved bottles from the entire 9 container for day 0 (D0) analysis, followed by analysis at day1 (D1), day 2 (D2), day 6 (D6) and day 9 (D9). Heavy metals analysis Samples were analyzed for heavy metals like Iron, Nickle, Cadmium, Lead, Zinc, Manganese, Copper and Chromium. Vacuum filtration of all the samples drawn from control containers and containers given DCP treatment was performed using nitrocellulose membrane of 0.42nm pore size. On the other hand, samples drawn from containers receiving liquid mucilage treatment was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes in order to separate the mucilage part from liquid sample (Mane et al., 2011). It was next followed by the addition of 2-3 drops of nitric acid in samples to stop any microbial activity. Metals detection was performed through Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Analyst 700), attached with graphite furnace (Richards, 1954). For every metal, the instrument was first standardized using different standards and doubled distilled water. Readings were then noted down for all the samples taken from plastic containers. Physiochemical analysis All 9 samples were analyzed for the following physiochemical parameters. Dissolved oxygen, EC and DO were determined for the samples using Lutron WA-2015 instrument. The instrument was first calibrated at pH 4 and 7 for pH and at 1.143mScm-1 for EC determination. Probe for Dissolved oxygen was calibrated by dipping probe in sodium sulphite solution. When the reading was stabilized, the reading was adjusted to zero. Similarly mercury thermometer was used for the recording of temperature of the samples. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 19 | Hassan et al. Carbonates and bicarbonates content was determined by titrating 5ml sample against 0.009N H2SO4 solution, using phenolphthalein as an indicator in case of CO3, while for HCO3, methyl orange was used as an indicator (Richards, 1954). 5ml sample was taken in a flask and 1 drop of phenolphthalein indicator was added. If solution turns pink, it shows presence of CO3 but there were no CO3 in solution and solution remained colorless.

Schooler,1 P.B. McEvoy1 and E.M. Coombs2 1 Oregon State University, Department of Entomology, Corvallis, OR, USA 2 Oregon Department of Agriculture, Plant Division, Salem, OR, USA Introduced plant species may affect local plant and animal community diversity and species richness. We studied the association between varying densities of two introduced wetland plants, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), on plant and moth species richness at sites within 24 palustrine emergent wetlands in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Seven wetlands were dominated by canary grass, seven were dominated by loosestrife, and ten were reference wetlands dominated by neither canary grass nor loosestrife. We measured plant community composition as percent cover and sampled the moth community using blacklight traps. One hundred and sixtynine plant and 178 moth species were identified. As the mean percent cover of canary grass and purple loosestrife increased from 0 to 91%, plant species richness declined from 45 to 4. We found a strong positive correlation between moth and plant species richness in rural wetlands. However, urban wetlands did not show this relationship. A strong negative association between reed canary grass and purple loosestrife abundance and plant and moth species diversity suggests that these two invasive species reduce local biodiversity. In addition, our data suggest that the influence of urban landscapes reduces moth species richness and abundance. The use of trap gardens in biological control: the case of blackberry, Rubus fruticosus and its agent, the rust Phragmidium violaceum John K. Scott,1 Mireille Jourdan2 and Katherine J. Evans3 1 Cooperative Research Centre for Australian Weed Management and CSIRO Entomology, Private Bag 5, PO Wembley, Western Australia 6913, Australia 2 CSIRO European Laboratory, Campus International de Baillarguet, 34980 Montferrier-sur-Lez, France 3 Cooperative Research Centre for Australian Weed Management, and Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research, New Town Research Laboratories, 13 St Johns Avenue, New Town, Tasmania 7008, Australia Trap gardens, where a garden of the target weed is planted in a region of origin and monitored for potential biological control agents, have been used extensively for the selection of agents. We review the approach used in past projects and examine the practicalities of this method using, for example, the garden of blackberry clones (Rubus fruticosus L. agg.) that was established to help selection of effective strains of the biological control agent, the rust Phragmidium violaceum (Schultz) Winter. Nineteen blackberry clones from Australia with known genotypes were imported into the CSIRO European Laboratory in France and established in a garden of four replicated blocks. Rust disease soon appeared on all plants, but not all weed clones showed the same susceptibility in the timing and degree of infection. Strains of the rust fungus were cultured from single pustules and these are undergoing genetic analyses to determine whether or not they are different from the rust fungus found in Australia. The host range of the purified strains is also being analysed. The garden was managed so as to prevent any gene flow to other European blackberries growing wild nearby. Eventually, the aggressive nature of some of the planted weed clones has required that we start a progressive destruction of the garden. The elimination of the trap garden started in 2002 and it will be important to monitor the garden site so as to confirm that no plants remain. We have shown that a trap garden of identified clones on blackberry Proceedings of the XI International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds 230 is feasible, safe and enables the rapid isolation of potential biological control agents for a plant where both the identity and exact origins are uncertain. Further gardens, perhaps with fewer clones, should be planted in other regions of interest, such as regions of high diversity of Rubus species, for example southern England, or in regions of climatic similarity to southern Australia, for example southern Portugal. Progress with the biological control program for Japanese knotweed Richard H. Shaw and Djamila H. Djeddour CABI Bioscience, UK Centre (Ascot) Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks, UK, SL5 7TA, UK Japanese knotweed is a rhizomatic perennial weed introduced into the UK, mainland Europe and the USA as a desirable ornamental plant during the 19th century. It soon lost its charm and was recognized as the potential weed that it has since become. It is now considered the most pernicious weed in the UK with an awesome reputation for displacing native vegetation and even concrete during its exponential spread. Previous studies suggested that Fallopia japonica is a very good potential target for biological control given its lack of natural enemies and apparent clonal nature. Phase 1 of a biocontrol program for the UK and USA was initiated in 2000. It involved a literature review and set-up mission to Japan. This visit/survey revealed a plant under severe natural enemy pressure with representatives from the more promising groups of arthropod and fungal potential agents, including a ubiquitous and damaging rust species. The promising results from this phase, along with observations in quarantine on some of the natural enemies encountered, are presented. This project has a good chance of being the first successful biological control program against a weed in Europe, as long as the political obstacles can be successfully negotiated. Biological control of privet in La Réunion: the story so far Richard H. Shaw and Harry C. Evans CABI Bioscience, UK Centre (Ascot) Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks, UK, SL5 7TA, UK. Privet, Ligustrum robustum ssp. walkeri, is a major invasive weed in the Mascarenes, threatening what is left of the native forest. Its impact on the now depauperate island of Mauritius led to the initiation of a classical biocontrol program for the neighbouring French island of La Réunion where the plant had recently arrived and was spreading rapidly. Molecular techniques revealed that the area of origin was Sri Lanka, but the apparent lack of suitable co-evolved agents, and fungi in particular, led the team back along the path of speciation eventually arriving at the centre of diversity of the genus in China. Although a different suite of natural enemies was found in each region surveyed, the most promising fungal agents belong to the little-studied and notoriously challenging Dothideales. One member of this order, Thedgonia ligustrina, does attack the target and remains of interest. Fortunately, this was one of the first classical programs to combine from the outset both entomology and pathology and, although the two survey disciplines can seem incompatible at times, it does result in a more efficient and costeffective approach. Numerous arthropods were rejected on the grounds of specificity, but a moth from Sri Lanka, Epiplema albida, proved to be suitably specific for consideration as a biocontrol agent. Cut foliage starvation tests were carried out on 89 plant species, followed by live plant tests on indigenous non-target Oleaceae. They revealed a high level of physiological specificity. Further lab testing confirmed that this insect is capable of completing development on only one species of non-target plant found in La Réunion and is highly unlikely to lay eggs on any species other than the target in the field. The decision whether to release the moth has yet to be made.","Abstract. Izzati U, Hasibuan HS. 2019. Riparian tree and bird diversity in Cisadane River, South Tangerang City, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 595-603. Riparian is a riverbank area that has unique characteristics. It is a combination of terrestrial with aquatic habitats so that riparian ecosystems have high biodiversity values. Riparian is included in a protected area that is naturally designated for vegetation, but in reality, riparian areas, especially in urban areas, have a lot of conversion of land functions by humans so that it can disrupt diversity of tree and bird species. This study aims to identify the diversity of tree and bird species and the correlation between the two. Riparian length of Cisadane River, South Tangerang City is 20.15 km. The method used was plot line with size of 20 m x 20 m for tree data and line transect for bird data by systematic sampling with a random start then analyzed using Shannon Wiener index. The results obtained were found 22 tree species included in 11 families with species diversity index (H') of 2.707 and 40 bird species belonging to 25 families with species diversity index (H') of 2.794. The diversity of tree and bird species is classified as medium. The results of the analysis using the Pearson correlation between the diversity of tree with bird species obtained that there was no relationship between the two. Based on these results, riparian zones in urban areas need to be maintained and improved in quality so that the diversity of tree and bird species increases so as to create a stable ecosystem.","(PNW) of 11 research The research units collectively conduct the most extensive and productive program of integrated forestry research in the The PNW Research 1925. The station has Oregon; 11 research laboratories and in Oregon, and Washington; and 11 active experimental areas (watershed, range, and experimental forests). The station also conducts research in more than 20 research natural areas. Our mission is to generate and communicate scientific knowledge that helps people understand and make informed choices about people, natural resources, and the environment. be management strategies, and This report traces the flow of timber harvested in Alaska during calendar year 2005, describes the composition and operations of the state’s primary forest products industry, and quantifies volumes and uses of wood fiber.

The study area includes 12 forested stands that encompass a representative range of dry forest conditions in the northeastern Cascade Range. We describe site histories and environmental settings, experimental design, field methods, and quantify the pretreatment composition and structure of vegetation, fuels, soils and soil biota, entomology and pathology, birds, and small mammals that occurred during the 2000 and 2001 field seasons. We also describe the implementation of thinning treatments and spring burning treatments during 2003, 2004, and 2006. (log-response ratio). All analyses yielded significant effect sizes for each class of fuels, although mixed-effects models had larger confidence intervals around mean effect sizes and smaller ranges in those means. The use of multiple methods produced a robust result for this study, but also carries the danger of selective interpretation if results are contradictory. Meta-analysis in fire research merits further consideration because it facilitates infer-ences across data sets reported by multiple authors, even when reporting is inconsistent. Nevertheless, standardized methodology, consistent measurement protocols, and complete reporting of both significant and nonsignificant results will greatly assist future synthesis efforts using metaanalysis. some treatment costs. Results indicate that removing large quantities of merchantable trees would be necessary to achieve fire hazard reduction goals. damage was low and predictable. The treatments were easy to apply, and these findings suggest that greater diversity in stand structures and plant communities can be accelerated by thinning with skips and gaps. western Oregon was initiated in 1994 to advance active management strategies to restore late-succession forest habitats, a key objective of the federal Northwest Forest Plan. DMS is one of several operational-scale management experiments in the region, but it is the only such study addressing the influences of thinning and buffers on riparian function and habitat. and urban areas. These novel experiments enabled researchers to quantify the rate at which different forms of nitrogen are processed and removed by stream organisms. They found that small streams are particularly effective at processing ammonium, an easily altered form of nitrogen, but that uptake of nitrate, a common pollutant, was comparatively limited. They also found that land use influences the efficiency of a waterway’s nitrogen processing abilities, and that stream systems are less efficient at processing and removing nitrogen when it is present in higher concentration. Management activities that increase channel complexity and maintain or enhance riparian vegetation can help reduce nitrogen loading and facilitate its processing. scrub land cover and modification of the watershed screening criteria yielded minimal changes to the results of FOTE 1. An extensive amount (26 million acres) of very-low-density residential development was projected on private forest land, but inclusion of these acres of change did not appreciably change the FOTE results. However, given the spatial extent of projected very-low-density residential development and its potential implications for ecological processes, additional research examining this type of development and its impact on natural resources is warranted. cars in a year. Had the 1.7 million metric tons of stored carbon been released through development, Oregon’s annual increase in carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 2000 would have been three times what it actually was. As policymakers look for ways to mitigate climate change, land use planning is a proven tool with measurable results. Forests have been an epicenter for the evolution of truffle fungi with over 350 truffle species and 55 genera currently identified. Truffle fungi develop their reproductive fruit-bodies typically belowground, so they are harder to find and study than mushrooms that fruit aboveground. Nevertheless, over the last five decades, the Corvallis Forest Mycology program of the Pacific Northwest Research Station has amassed unprecedented knowledge on the diversity and ecology of truffles in the region. Truffle fungi form mycorrhizal symbioses that benefit the growth and survival of many tree and understory plants. Truffle fruit-bodies serve as a major food source for many forest-dwelling mammals. A few truffle species are commercially harvested for gourmet consumption in regional restaurants. This publication explores the biology and ecology of truffle fungi in the Pacific Northwest, their importance in forest ecosystems, and effects of various silvicultural practices on sustaining truffle populations. General management principles and considerations to sustain this valuable fungal resource are provided. p. This guidebook describes Benjamin Research Natural Area, a 258-ha (637-ac) tract originally established to represent an example of the western juniper/Idaho fescue ( Juniperus occidentalis/Fes-tuca idahoensis ) plant association. Subsequent field surveys indicate the predominant vegetation is best characterized as the western juniper/low sagebrush/ Idaho fescue plant association. Current vegetation is dominated by western juniper woodland with an understory vegetation mosaic that varies with soil depth. Low sagebrush ( Artemisia arbuscula Nutt.) occurs as the major shrub in shallow or rocky soils, and Wyoming big sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young) predominates in areas with deeper or more finely textured soil. The continued conversion and development of forest land pose a serious threat to the ecosystem services derived from forested landscapes. We argue that developing an understanding of the full range of consequences from forest conversion requires understanding the effects of such conversion on both components of ecosystem services: products and processes. However, there are unavoidable challenges involved in quantifying the threats from forest conversion and their related costs to human well-being. First, most attempts to quantify the costs of forest conversion on ecosystem services will necessarily rely on specific ecological science that is often emerging, changing, or simply nonexistent. For example, the role that many species play in ecosystem processes is poorly understood. Second, given the interconnected nature of ecosystem products and processes, any attempt to quantify the effects of forest conversion must grapple with jointness in production. For example, the cost of losing a species from forest conversion must account for that species’ role as both (1) a product that directly contributes to human well-being, and (2) as a component in an ecosystem process. Finally, the ecology and the human dimensions of ecosystems are highly specific to spatial-temporal circumstances. Consequently, the effects of forest conversion in one spatial-temporal context are likely to be quite different than effects elsewhere. association, the western juniper/big sagebrush/blue-bunch wheatgrass ( Juniperus occidentalis/Artemisia tridentata/Pseudoroegneria spicata ) plant associa-tion, and the western juniper/bluebunch wheatgrass ( Juniperus occidentalis/Pseudoroegneria spicata ) plant association. by 2025; and in Washington, both these segments of the population may double. The compilation of papers in this proceeding is based on a symposium sponsored by the Insect and Diseases Working Group (D5) at the 2007 Society of American Foresters (SAF) convention in Portland, Oregon. The selection of topics parallels the research priorities of the Western Bark Beetle Research Group (WBBRG) (USDA Forest Service, Research and Development), which had been recently formed at the time of the symposium. Reflecting a unique partnership within the Forest Service, each paper was jointly prepared by a research scientist with the WBBRG and one or more entomologists with Forest Health Protection (USDA Forest Service, State and Private Forestry). Among these papers is a description of the currently elevated impacts of bark beetles in the Western United States; descriptions of the current state of knowledge of bark beetle response to vegetation management and also to climate change; discussions of the complex interactions of bark beetles and fire and of the complex ecological and socioeconomic impacts of infestations; an overview of the use of semiochemical (behavioral chemicals)-based technology for conifer protection; and a case study exemplifying efforts to assess risks posed by nonnative invasive bark beetles. the establishment and management of natural areas in areas devoted to research, education, and conservation of biodiversity. collection of is now unmatched in its diversity and represe","As the human population increases, the landscape is altered to provide housing, food, and industry. Human activity poses a risk to the health of natural habitats that, in turn, affect biodiversity. Biodiversity is necessary for a functioning ecosystem, as species work synergistically to create a livable environment. It is, therefore, important to know how human practices and natural events threaten these habitats and the species living in them. A universal method of modeling habitat threats does not exist. This paper details the use of a literature review to formulate a new framework called Define–Investigate–Estimate–Map (DIEM). This framework is a process of defining threats, investigating an area to discover what threats are present, estimating the severity of those threats, and mapping the threats. Analysis of 62 studies was conducted to determine how different authors define and characterize threats in various contexts. The results of this analysis were then applied to a case study to evaluate the Choctawhatchee River and Bay Watershed. Results suggest that the most abundant threat in the watershed is agricultural development, and the most destructive threat is urban development. These two threats have the greatest impact on the total threat level of the watershed. Applying the DIEM framework demonstrates its helpfulness in regional analysis, watershed modeling, and land development planning.","Interview with Dr. Lucas Matias Leveau, a Research Assistant and teacher of Community Ecology at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In tropical zones, wetland microbial dynamics remain poorly understood. Chemical parameters, heavy metal content, and microbiological community structure were investigated in surface sediments of the Santa Maria del Lago (SML) wetland in Bogota, Colombia. High-throughput sequencing was employed to generate RNAr 16S and nosZ gene sequence data with which bacteria, archaea, and nosZ-type denitrifier community composition and their phylogenetic relationships were investigated. A canonical correspondence analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between assessed environmental variables and microbial community composition. Results showed that the most abundant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria (group GP18), and Aminicenantes; Archaea were represented by the taxa Methanomicrobia and Thermoprotei, and the nosZ community was dominated by Candidatus Competibacter denitrificans. A phylogenetic analysis revealed a high diversity of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), according to 16S rRNA gene sequence data; however, the quantity and diversity of OTUs from the nosZ community were low compared to previous studies. High concentrations of ammonium, phosphorus, organic carbon, Pb, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Cd, were detected in sediments, but they were not strongly related to observed microbial community compositions. In conclusion, in the same polluted SML wetland sediments diverse bacteria and archaea communities were detected, although not nosZ-type denitrifiers.","Jon Mathieu is to Alpine history what Werner B€atzing (eg B€atzing 2015) is to Alpine geography—that is, arguably the most accomplished and influential scholar of our time in his discipline. Is Mathieu to the Alps what Braudel is to the Mediterranean? Only time will tell if this book will have the same impact for the history of European civilization and for historiography as La M editerran ee (Braudel 1949). It is not that there is a lack of references to the French maı̂tre in this book. The index mentions 6 places, including 3 long passages, where Mathieu tries to do justice to Braudel’s infamous dismissal of the Alps as being at the margins of European history. Mathieu is not the first scholar to dispute Braudel’s provocative assertion, but The Alps is arguably one of the most eloquent arguments against it. It differs from B€atzing’s perspective as it does not claim any centrality of the Alps for European history. Rather, it adopts the viewpoint of the exceptionality of the Alps from all perspectives, portraying the region as a laboratory where the past, present, and future of Europe are forged. The Alps is the updated, expanded, and abridged version of Mathieu’s extremely well documented masterpiece History of the Alps 1500–1900: Environment, Development, and Society, published in German in 1998 and English in 2009 (Mathieu 2009). First published in German, The Alps is now available to a global audience thanks to a translation by Rose Hadshar. This book, based on an extensive review of German, French, Italian, and English literature, as well as, of course, a variety of historical documents and other sources, succeeds in the difficult task of producing a balanced overview that looks at the Alps as a whole. If examples from Switzerland are slightly more prominent than those from other countries, this is understandable, as the author is from this country, where he has been working for decades, first in Lugano and now in Lucerne. In any case, the book covers all parts of the Alps, from France to Slovenia, and from Italy to Bavaria. Starting from the premise that conducting a historical overview—from prehistoric times to modern days—of an area that stretches over 1200 km must be undertaken selectively, Mathieu chooses to combine a rapid chronological history of the Alps with a thematic analysis of specific historical and geographical aspects such as religious culture, social inequality, migration, and agriculture. By adopting a thematic approach, which is increasingly frequent in contemporary historiography, this book manages to capture key aspects of Alpine history through select glimpses. If it is not always clear how episodes and examples were selected, they are always significant and, altogether, help make sense of Alpine history. This narrative choice means that the author does not get lost in a chronological narrative that would probably have missed many significant aspects. His synchronic approach may disorient the reader at times but brings forward all the elephants in the room of Alpine history. One example is an interesting analysis of Hannibal’s crossing as a founding myth of Alpine history, analyzed not only as a historical fact but also as a symbol in different times of Alpine history. A chronological approach would probably have missed this important dimension. By analyzing the economic, social, and environmental relationships between the ‘‘core’’ area of the Alps and its periphery, Mathieu also argues that the exceptional nature of the Alps rests in their historical connection with economically dynamic surrounding areas, such as Lombardy, the Lyon area, and the Upper Rhine, among others. In this regard, the methodology used is particularly interesting, as it highlights the complex and nondichotomous interactions between the Alpine mountain range and surrounding urban areas, as well as between human societies and their natural environment. Paradoxically, The Alps misses out on the dimension that perhaps most readers would look for: environmental history, as per the subtitle in the English version, which is slightly misleading. The German version has a different subtitle, which better reflects the contents of the book: environment, culture, history. In fact, Mathieu reduces the environment to the geographical scope of the Alps as a given mountain area and to the social construction and practices of this area over time. There is very little in this book about the natural history of the Alps, whether nonanthropogenic change or the several more or less recent anthropogenic changes, some due to local and regional dynamics, such as forest cover and biodiversity loss, and others due to global driving forces, such as climate change. The author may have done so to avoid any suspicion of environmental determinism, putting forward the work of the men and women who contributed to shaping collectively, and sometimes individually, the history of this mountain range. However, to live up to its subtitle, this book should have engaged more with environmental change, particularly the impact of endogenous and exogenous environmental change, on Alpine history. The author already goes outside of his disciplinary comfort zone when he engages, for instance, with the role of the process of European integration. He should perhaps have done this even more to deal more with the environmental dimension.

Recording responses within the first neuronal network along the olfactory pathway, the antennal lobe, we investigate to what degree odour stim-ulus information is encoded in space, frequency and time fea-tures of the neuronal responses. In this way, it is possible to highlight the neural networks that are the basis of the amazing cognitive functions contained in a volume of no more than one cubic millimeter of brain and, perhaps, also contribute to counteract the very complex and partly unknown phenomenon of the Colony Collapse Disorder. An increasingly diverse array of toxic pollutants with uncer- tain ecological effects is being discharged into Albanian coastal waters, and detecting their impacts on the health condition of marine and estuarine biota is one of the most important and dif-ficult challenges facing researchers and environmental man- agers. More than one third of the Adriatic coast in Albania is being eroded and accelerated by removing gravel and sand from beaches for construction industry, uncontrolled construction along the coast, deforestation of large coastal areas, and agri- cultural development. Increased migration to coastal areas has resulted in uncontrolled harvest of coastal and marine resources as well as in increasing pollution of marine and coastal waters, especially in lagoons. Most pollution comes from urban and industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals used in agriculture. Discharging the pharmaceutical waste into water is a relatively new phenomenon emerging nowadays, which of course affect biodiversity. Our approach was to establish a link among con- taminants, molecular and cellular biomarkers, using crabs as res-ident sentinel species for assessing habitat condition and diag- nosing stressors. In the present study, a suite of biomarkers like neutral red retention time (NRRT), glucose, total haemocyte count (THC), and oxidative enzyme activities (CAT, SOD), were evaluated in Carcinus aestuarii crabs collected from Lagoon of Narta, Vlora, Albania. Obtained results revealed a significant alteration of each specific biomarker due to presence of pollutants in water column and sediment. The integrated approach between biomarkers and chemical analysis of water and sediment, is a useful tool in biomonitoring estuarine The use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been pro- hibited since the 1970s in western nations. However, their widespread use and chemical stability has led to extensive environ- mental contamination, even in remote areas. PCBs can be trans-formed into chemical substances by different microbial metabol- ic pathways. This work was aimed at analyzing Antarctic bacterial strains able to degrade PCBs at low temperature, with a focus on the metabolic pathways. Water and sediment samples were collected in four different lakes (EP-1, EP-2, EP-3 and EP-4) in the Edmonson Point area (Antarctica). Isolates were obtained from biphenyl enriched cultures, and preliminarily screened for their ability to use Aroclor 1242 as sole carbon source. Positive strains were identified by the 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing, and the presence of the bphA gene, involved in the first step of aerobic degradation of PCBs, was screened by PCR amplification. Results showed that 57 out of 192 isolates were able to grow in the presence of Aroclor 1242, with the 25.5% and 18.6% that were from sediment and water, respectively. Further, the 87.5% of the positive strains sowed the presence of the bphA gene and were mainly affiliated to Actinobacteria (mainly genera Salinibacterium and Arthrobacter ) and physical examination, echocardiography and ambulatory electrocardiogram were performed. The DNA sequences of each fragment were aligned and screened for mutations using MEGA 6. In TCAP exon 2, a silent SNP (g. 29957 T&gt;C of AAEX01022011) was detected in both DCM-affected and DCM-unaffected group. Our results showed no evidence that this gene is involved in DCM in the Great Dane dog. Detection of DCM-associated variants would contribute to development of genetic tools for rapid screening of families at risk for inherited disease and to improvement the methods of diagnosis and therapy. In this study we report a preliminary characterization of the intestinal mycobiota of Nero Siciliano pig, an autochthonous pig breed reared in the internal areas of Sicily island (Italy). A total of 21 pigs, from a swine farm in Messina, were collected using rectal swabs. For yeasts isolation, each swab was streaked on three Sabouraud’s agar plates containing antibiotics and cultures were incubated at 30°C for 72 hours. Forty-eight yeast strains were recovered from fecal specimens and initially, presumptively, identified using convention- al morphological and physiological tests. Identification at the species level was then confirmed by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the ITS1-5,8S-ITS2 region of the riboso-mal DNA according to previous studies. Results showed that eight different fungal genera colonized diseases, such as inflammation, and cancer. In addition, some marine organisms, that live in extreme or variables conditions, are able to synthesize some potential photo-protective compounds, which could be used in the prevention of cellular damage caused by ultraviolet radia-tion, as anti-photo-aging agents. The aim of the study was the discovery and the evaluation, in vitro , of new bioactive compounds from Mediterranean marine organisms and their potential utilization in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries. The obtained results showed, in different cell lines, a significant improvement of the cellular antioxidant power, the ability to promote cells renewal and the induction of a skin–whitening effect. The obtained results provide some innovative applications of Mediterranean marine compounds in cosmeceuticals and medical research. the of production the carbon NaCl and Incubation at 4°C, 2% sucrose and 3% NaCl concentration in the and pH 7 determined as optimal conditions.

The current therapy used for the cure of malaria is based on the administration of a series of artemisinin derivatives (ACTs) combined with longer half-life quinolines. The resistance to ACTs, is a major thread for the control and elimina-tion of malaria due to P. falciparum . The need for new antimalarial drugs is more urgent than ever before, with emerging strains of the parasite now showing resistance against the best available drugs. Recently has been demonstrated that Syk inhibitors represent a new class of antimalarial drugs by suppressing merozoite egress by inhibiting the host target that cannot be mutated by the parasite to evolve drug resistance. In this study, our target is to evaluate the in vitro combination activity of Syk inhibitors with Artemisinins and understand their mechanistic interaction. We show that Syk inhibitors present an in vitro synergistic combination with all tested Artemisinins against P. falciparum . Furthermore, we observed that Syk inhibitors determine a massive accumulation of hemichromes in the parasitized erythrocytes triggering the activation of artemisinins and leading to a marked synergistic effect if administered in combination. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies represent a high-throughput, automated, fast and economical tool in order to deep investigate whole genomes and transcrip-tomes. Here we present an overview of bioinformatics approaches that could be applied for NGS data analysis in microbiology, from de novo and reference-guided genome assembly and relative annotation, transcriptome assembly, differential gene expression analysis, SNPs discovery, to phylogenomics. After sequencing, short sequenced fragments (reads) are filtered to remove adapters and low-quality sequences; the remaining high-quality reads are then assembled ( i.e. with SOAPdenovo2, SPAdes) or mapped against a reference genome (bwa, bowtie) or reconstructed based on this latter (IMR-DENOM, Reconstructor). BUSCO and QUAST programs can be used to evaluate the assembly results. Annotation can be performed using ab initio gene pre-dictors, tRNA, rRNA and repeats searc","Chinese metropolitan areas have been experiencing urbanization over the past decades, impacting biodiversity, carbon emissions, urban heat islands, and food security. Yet, systematic research on spatio-temporal urbanization patterns and drivers along the urban–rural gradient is rarely reported for northwest China. Here, we use land-use data from 1980 to 2015 to explore land-use change, urbanization intensity, and drivers in northwest China. Our results display direct and indirect effects of urban expansion on farmland loss, but also spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the urbanization patterns. While the earlier years were dominated by infill and land conversion close to city centers, the later years displayed sprawling urbanization following the constraints of terrain and administrative boundaries at the cost of farmland. Our regression analysis of spatial variables found a strong relationship with urban planning factors. The spatial analysis of urbanization patterns revealed indirect land-use change on former farmland. Furthermore, we found that regional geography and historic sites considerably influenced land conversion. Overall, our findings indicate the need for sustainable planning strategies that synthesize approaches to farmland and historic site protection and consideration of regionally specific landscape characteristics.","RESUME: Depuis sa creation en 1998, le parc marin du Saguenay-Saint-Laurent (PMSSL), situe \ndans la province du Quebec, protege une portion representative du Saint-Laurent et de son \nprincipal tributaire, le fjord du Saguenay. Dans cette vaste zone cotiere, l'etonnante \nbiodiversite et la complexite des ecosystemes sont confrontees aux activites humaines et a \nleurs multiples impacts. Afin de soutenir les gestionnaires du parc marin dans leurs efforts \nde conservation, nous avons adapte un modele de risques relatifs afin de servir d'outil de \ngestion pour localiser les zones cumulant le plus de risques environnementaux, identifier \nles sources anthropiques de stress impliquees et developper des approches de gestion \npermettant de reduire les risques et augmenter le niveau general de protection du parc. \nAvant de mettre en place un tel outil, nous nous sommes interesses aux variables \ngouvernant les risques environnementaux dans notre region d'etude et avons procede a une \nmise a jour ciblee des donnees existantes, necessaire au developpement de notre modele. \nNous avons d'abord caracterise les principales sources de contamination terrestre (encore \npeu documentees), pour ensuite determiner le niveau d'exposition des ecosystemes a celles-ci. \nNos resultats ont montre que la contamination du parc etait ubiquiste mais distribuee de \nmaniere heterogene dans les ecosystemes car influencee par la localisation des activites \nhumaines et des facteurs environnementaux. Plus particulierement, nous avons identifie les \nrejets d'effluents municipaux comme une source importante de contamination au niveau \nlocal mais un vecteur peu important face a la contamination diffuse apportee par le fleuve \nSaint-Laurent et la riviere Saguenay. Nous avons estime la contribution relative de celle-ci \nde 88 a 100 % en fonction du contaminant considere . De plus, une analyse detaillee de la \ncomposition en hydrocarbures aromatiques polycycliques (HAP) nous a permis de mettre \nen evidence l'influence du trafic maritime (une source non terrestre) sur la contamination du \nparc. Enfin, des donnees inattendues ont particulierement retenu notre attention. Dans la \nbaie Sainte-Marguerite, un site important pour le beluga (une espece menacee du parc \nmarin), nous avons enregistre les concentrations en HAP et metaux lourds les plus elevees \ndu parc marin, en l'absence de source locale de contamination. Notre meilleure hypothese \nrepose sur la presence de facteurs hydrodynamiques, influencant le transport et \nl'accumulation de contaminant dans ce secteur. Neanmoins, des travaux complementaires \nseront necessaires pour approfondir la question. Dans leur ensemble, ces resultats nous ont permis de consolider nos connaissances \nexistantes sur le stress anthropique et ont contribue a une meilleure comprehension des \nimpacts lies aux activites humaines dans le PMSSL. Nous les avons ensuite integres afin de developper notre outil de gestion environnementale. Ce premier deploiement du modele sur \nle territoire du parc nous a permis de tirer un portrait regional des risques dans le parc \nmarin. Les resultats ont permis d'identifier l'embouchure du fjord ainsi que la zone cotiere \nde l'estuaire maritime comme les secteurs les plus a risques dans le parc marin et \nd'incriminer le trafic maritime, les effluents municipaux et le ruisselement urbain comme \nles sources principales de stress. Grâce a sa flexibilite le modele peut etre utilise pour \nsimuler differents scenarios de gestion environnementale. Cette fonctionnalite permet \nd'evaluer les benefices probables de chaque action potentielle avant de statuer sur la \nmeilleure approche. Nous avons teste deux options de gestion dans les zones les plus \nexposees aux risques du parc: (1) la mise en place de traitements efficaces des effluents \nmunicipaux et (2) une diminution de l'intensite du trafic maritime. Selon les predictions du \nmodele, la mise en application de ces actions environnementales diminuerait le risque \nenvironnemental relatif de 25 a 32 %. Nous recommandons donc aux gestionnaires du \nPMSSL de prioriser leurs efforts de gestion sur l'amelioration du traitement des eaux usees \nmunicipales et une meilleure regulation du trafic maritime dans les secteurs de \nl'embouchure et de l'estuaire maritime. La souplesse du modele est finalement une garantie \nde la perennite de notre outil. Celui-ci etant un systeme ouvert, il sera possibles de realiser \ndes optimisations et des mises a jours, au gres des avances des connaissances scientifiques. -- ABSTRACT: Since its foundation in 1998, the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (SSLMP), \nlocated in the Province of Quebec, is protecting a significant portion of the St. Lawrence \nEstuary and the Saguenay Fjord. In this large coastal area, the important biodiversity and \ncomplexity of the ecosystem are facing human activities and their multiple impacts. In \nsupport to conservation goals, we adapted the relative risk model (RRM) as a management \ntool to highlight the zones the most at risk, identify the main sources of stress and develop \nenvironmental strategies to reduce global risk level in the Park. \nTo build such a model we focussed on variables governing environmental risk in this \nmarine area and proceeded to an update of the necessary dataset to develop our tool. The \nrelative significance of main land-based inputs on the global environmental contamination \nwere first developed and then we examined the chemical and microbial contamination of \nseveral compartments of the ecosystem in the main semi-enclosed bays and streams of the \nSaguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park (SSLMP). Our study provided a first estimation of \neach source of contamination, particularly local ones, as only a few unpublished data were \npreviously available. Results showed a ubiquitous contamination but a heterogeneous \ndistribution of the contamination in the ecosystem of the marine park in relation with the \nlocation of human activities. Particularly, urban effluents were highlighted as an important \nsource of stress at a local scale but a low contributor to global contamination compared to \ndiffuse external inputs from the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers, which relative \napportionment was estimated from 88 to 100% depending on the analysed pollutant. This \nhuge discrepancy between sources is mainly driven by their daily discharge but also by \nsome local hydrodynamic factors discussed in this paper. Moreover, a closer look at the \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) distribution in intertidal sediments revealed the \ninfluence of maritime traffic. Finally, unexpected data were subject to a special focus. In \nthe Bay of Sainte-Marguerite, an important site for belugas (endangered species of the \nPark), in absence of any local source of contamination, the highest level of contamination \nfor PAH and some metals was recorded. Some hypotheses are discussed to explain \nobservations and provide insight for further works on contamination fate in this bay. The information derived from the bulk analysis and multi-contaminant data provided \ngood insights to enforce our understanding of anthropogenic stress in the SSLMP. Then, \ndataset was integrated to develop our tool. This first deployment of the methodology over a \nmarine conservation area allowed to depict the regional environmental pressure from \nmultiple anthropogenic sources of stress in the SSLMP. The RRM highlighted the mouth of the Saguenay Fjord and the coastal area of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary as the subregions \nto be the most at risk and incriminated vessel traffic, sewage discharges and urban \nrunoff as the main sources of stress in those areas. Moreover, the flexibility of this risk \nmodel allowed us to proactively explore future management options (to deal with \nenvironmental risks) and assess their probable benefits. The RRM predicts that the \nimplementation of wastewater treatment plans (to solve contamination problems) and a \nreduction of the navigation pressure would decrease the global risk from 25 to 32% in the \nsub-regions identified as the most at risk.

Four sampling locations were selected (ABUTH, NAPRI, Marabar Guga and ABU Dam Quarters in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria main campus which served as the control site). Soil samples were collected at 0, 50, 100 and 200 m distances from the roadside in three replicates, air dried at room temperature, sieved and kept in specimen bottles with appropriate labels pending analysis. Samples were digested and analyzed for concentrations of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn) and Manganese (Mn) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Concentrations of these heavy metals were observed to be significantly higher at 0 m than the other distances from the roadside and this decreased with increasing distance from the roadside. There was generally no significant difference in soil heavy metal concentration at 50200 m from the roadside. Soil lead concentration was mostly observed to be higher than that of all other metals studied. The concentrations of heavy metals observed in the soil samples was in the order of Pb&gt;Mn&gt;Zn &gt;Cd &gt;Cu. The contamination factors for individual heavy metal for the locations showed low to moderate contamination by the metals. Among the locations studied, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, (ABUTH) showed the highest concentration of the most heavy metals while ABU Dam Quarters (Control), had the lowest concentration of most of the heavy metals. The study showed that, nearness to the roadside increased the soil heavy metal concentrations and this could invariably influence the same in crops planted or farm produce being dried along the roadside. *Corresponding Author: S.

Sci. 2017 2 | Garba and Alonge Introduction Environmental contaminants are widely distributed in air, water, soils and sediments. Among the environmental pollutants, metals are of particular concern, due to their potential toxic effect and ability to bio-accumulate in ecosystems (Censi et al., 2006).There has been increasing concern on the effect of vehicle emission on the environment. Heavy metals enter the environment as a result of both natural and anthropogenic activities (He et al., 2004). Heavy metals in the soil originate from many sources, which include atmospheric deposition, vehicular emission, and sewage irrigation, improper stacking of the industrial solid waste, mining activities, the use of pesticides and fertilizers (Zhang et al., 2011). Heavy metals released from vehicular emission can accumulate in surface soils and their deposition over time can lead to abnormal enrichment, thus causing metal contamination of the surface soils (Fong et al., 2008). Heavy metals are important group of pollutants as they are non-biodegradable, hence are not readily detoxified and removed by metabolic activities once they are available in the environment. This may subsequently lead to their build up to toxic levels or bio-accumulation in the ecosystem. Bio-accumulation of these heavy metals in man, animals and plants result in metal poisoning (Audu and Lawal, 2005). Some of these metals are micronutrients necessary for plant growth, such as Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Co, while others have unknown biological function, such as Cd, Pb, and Hg (Gaur and Adholeya, 2004). In the last few decades, anthropogenic activities like industrial and energy production, construction, waste disposal, domestic heating system and motor vehicles are continuously contributing towards an increase in the level of heavy metals in urban soils (Lee et al., 2005). Although, there have been a number of studies on heavy metals in roadside soils, majority of these have been carried out in developed countries with long history of industrialization and use of leaded gasoline. Very few studies have been carried out in the Northern guinea savanna agro ecological zone of Nigeria. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the concentration of heavy metals in soil samples along Samaru-Giwa road, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. The result of this study will indicate the level of pollution in the studied areas and can be used by relevant authorities for environmental monitoring. Materials and methods Study area The study was conducted at three locations (Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI), Marabar Guga and ABU Dam Quarters in Ahmadu Bello University,(ABU), Zaria, Main campus, along Samaru-Giwa road, Zaria, Nigeria. Zaria is located at 07 ̊33’E and 11 ̊12’N in Kaduna State, Nigeria, within the Northern Guinea Savanna agroecological zone of Nigeria. Ahmadu Bello University Dam Quarters, a low traffic density area within the University, Samaru, Zaria, Nigeria, served as the control. The sampling locations were uncultivated lands characterized by different vegetation cover. Sample Collection Soil samples were collected using stainless steel spoon materials at a distance of 0, 50, 100 and 200 m from the roadside in three replications at 10 m apart at each distance. In each location, a total of 12 soil samples were collected. Samples collected were put in clean Polyethene bags with appropriate labels and brought to the Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. The samples were spread in clean plastic trays and allowed to air dry. Plants and hard materials were removed from the samples. After seven days, soil samples were sieved using a 2 mm stainless steel sieve to remove lumps and clumps of soil together with organic materials. The sieved soil samples were kept in clean polythene bags with appropriate labels for physical and chemical analysis. J. Bio. Env.

Geneva: WHO Chronicle, 2:31–388. Physico chemical properties of the soil samples, which include soil pH, Textural class and Total Organic Matter were determined at the Department of Soil Science Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Ahamdu Bello University, Zaria. Soil digestion Soil samples were digested at the Multi-User Science Research Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. Samples were digested for heavy metal analysis using the method of Ogunfowokan et al. (2009). In this method, each soil sample was digested with Nitric and Hydrochloric acids (HNO3: HCl) in the ratio of 3:1. For each soil sample, 0.5 g was weighed and put in a 100 ml beaker with appropriate label and 7.5 ml of HNO3 and 2.5 ml of HCl were simultaneously added to the beaker containing each soil sample. The beakers were immediately placed on a thermostat hotplate at 150 oC. The samples were allowed to boil to colourless fluid before they were removed from the hotplate. Deionized water was added to make the volume to 50 ml mark. The contents were allowed to cool down to room temperature before the contents were filtered with a Whatman No.1 filter paper into a 50 ml volumetric flask. The supernatant were transferred into clean white sample bottles with appropriate labels. A blank determination was carried out using the procedure described above without the sample. The Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and Mn concentrations were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Contamination factor (CF) The level of contamination of soil by the heavy metals was expressed in terms of a contamination factor (CF) calculated as described by Reboredo (1993). CF = Cm Sample/Cm background, where: cm sample is concentration of metal in the samples, cm background is the background value of the metal. Contamination factor of: CF &lt; 1 refers to low contamination; 1 ≤ CF &lt; 3 means moderate contamination; 3 ≤ CF ≤ 6 indicates considerable contamination and CF &gt; 6 indicates very high contamination. Statistical analysis Data generated from this study were subjected to oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using SPSS package Version 20. Significant differences in means were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at P ≤ 0.05. Results The soil properties that were determined include pH, particles sizes and total organic matter (TOM). Soil pH of the samples ranged from 6.31 -6.97 which is an indication of being mildly acidic. Soil texture ranged between loam to sandy loam soil. Organic matter content was observed to be in the range of 0.48-3.34 % (Table 1). The analysis of the combined data on distance from the roadside showed that, the concentration of Cu observed at 0 m from the road was significantly higher than that from 50 200 m from the road (Table 3). The analysis of the pooled data from all the locations showed that, the highest concentration of copper observed at NAPRI was similar to that at other locations (Table 4). Generally, the data from most locations and the combined data analysis showed that, all the heavy metals had the highest concentrations at 0 m from the roadside. This was significantly higher than that of other distances for Pb, Cu and Zn, while that of Mn was comparable with that at 100 and 200 m, but that of Cd was similar to that observed at other distances from the roadside.

Indisputable evidence from the upland terrace of Ag. Ioannis/Vretsia-Roudias in the Paphos district, showing a habitation palimpsest from the Late Epipalaeolithic to the Aceramic Neolithic - including solid architectural remains - discuss the possibility that hinterland areas were not marginal ‘microcosms’ and they should not be underrepresented in Cypriot archaeology. The presentation will discuss issues of marginality in relation to the island’s coastal areas and the need to include the systematic research of inland Cyprus. This paper presents a zooarchaeological study of Later Aceramic Neolithic (LAN) Ag. Ioannis/Vretsia-Upper Roudias . Until recently, Neolithic habitation in Cyprus was thought to have been restricted to the coastal plains. The discovery of Roudias and other upland sites renders this picture obsolete. The general picture of human-animal interactions is one of gradual increase in the importance of domesticates since their introduction in late 9 th -early 8 th millennia BCE at the expense of hunting. By the mid-8 th and 7 th millennia (LAN) animal herding peaked but hunting remained of paramount importance. Our current knowledge, however, is based on a handful of assemblages from coastal sites. This bias enhances Roudias’ potential for a fuller understanding of Neolithic lifeways in Cyprus. Based on preliminary results, this paper speculates on which animal-related activities were carried out at the site, as well as the nature of its occupation. The discussion of animal husbandry and hunting strategies provides new information on everyday life at an upland LAN site. Differences and similarities in human-animal interactions are examined through comparisons between Roudias and coeval coastal sites. Moreover, the preliminary results presented here are placed in the wider context of Neolithic Cyprus through comparisons with earlier, coeval and later assemblages. The focus of archaeobotanical studies in Cyprus has been on the Neolithic period exploring issues such as the colonization of the island. This paper will present data from the subsequent Bronze Age in an attempt to initiate the discussion of the agricultural practices and economic models which developed during a period of substantial economic and social transformations. Focusing on data from Kalavasos, Erimi, Ambelia, Hala Sultan Teke and Pyla, the paper will investigate evidence of social storage, exchange systems, intensification of agricultural production and the level of specialization, if any, in the urban centers of the period. This paper considers the role of seafaring as one of the most important aspects of ‘everyday life’ in the prehistoric communities of Cyprus. By the eleventh millennium Cal BC in the wider Mediterranean, the limited and tentative forays into the sea ( seagoing ) that typified the Late Pleistocene rapidly morphed into a more adept, practiced form of seafaring , and the sea became a ‘vector for travel’, not just a ‘provider of resources’. The maritime capabilities developed by these early seafarers enabled them to explore new lands and seas, tap new marine resources and make use of accessible coastal sites. Prehistoric seafaring extended peoples’ habitats and gave them access to resources that lay near and beyond the shore. In the beginning, seafaring increased the range and links of fisher-foragers and, in time, it facilitated the movement of migrants and certain resources in demand; ultimately, it paved the way for merchants and colonists to operate on a much greater scale, facilitating the bulk transport of goods and the expansion of trade, and enabling the establishment of sea-based states and kingdoms. The core activities of seafaring thus revolved around the exploitation of marine and coastal resources, the mobility of people and the transport and exchange of goods. On Cyprus, although we lack direct material evidence (e.g. shipwrecks or ship representations) before the Middle Bronze Age (post-2000 BC), there is no question that beginning at least by the Late Epipalaeolithic, prehistoric ‘voyagers’ sailed between the Levantine mainland and Cyprus, in all likelihood several times per year, in order to transport large ruminants like weaned calves or small wild boar on boats much more sophisticated than ever imagined. In the long stretch of time — some 7000 years — between the Early Aceramic Neolithic and the Bronze Age, it would seem — prima facie — that the inhabitants of Cyprus turned their backs to the sea. This study considers the likelihood that Cyprus was never truly isolated from the sea: all early seafaring communities had an ‘attitude’ to the sea, and the ‘business of seafaring’ involves travelling upon and making a living from the sea, enabling not The mammalian fauna of Cyprus has been extensively evaluated as an indicative example of how humans affected insular biodiversity to shift from endemic species to imported synanthropic and domestic ones. Such evaluations concern usually large mammals of economic importance for man, however rodents, and in particular mice, are excellent habitat markers and thus absolutely informative for insular biodiversity shifts. The proposed presentation will focus on the house mouse, a bioproxy used by zooarchaeologists to infer human mobility as well as habitat shift. We will present the onset and diachronic presence of house mice on Cyprus from the onset of human sedentary presence on the island and throughout the Neolithic period. We will compare the density of mouse presence in these settlements across time and also the type of contexts, where mice have been found. We will also discuss the overall subject of house mouse synanthropy on Cyprus that constitutes the earliest dispersal of this species outside the Middle East, which has been proven to be the cradle of its commensalism, and the simultaneous presence of cats, which were probably brought to the island due to mice. The data that will be presented are part of the results of an interdisciplinary project targeting the house mouse commensalism and dispersal from the Middle East to Europe. This project, named MOUSETRACK, combined innovative methodologies, namely geometric morphometrics and ancient DNA analysis to tackle its questions. at Klimonas, The village includes more than 26 buildings (including a remarkable 10-m diameter communal building) that were similar to those found on Late PPNA sites on the continent. Spatial data combined to soil micromorphology provides a view of the successive phases of building use and renovation. Pattern of occupation and radiocarbon dates indicate a complex history over a relatively short period of time (less than one century). Cereals were introduced from the Levant, and animal food was obtained by hunting the only ungulate living on the island, a small autochthonous Cypriot wild boar. A large array of stone tools productions is related to plant and game collect, processing and consumption on the site. The presence of various pigments and the identification of the full manufacture sequence of personal ornaments at the site also attest of non-utilitarian productions. Stone tool, faunal remain and shell and stone pendant deposits within trenches under various buildings highlight the symbolic value of some particular categories of the material culture of this community. Systematic sampling and analysis of botanical macroremains (wood, seeds, fruits) from into daily of whether fundamental in prehistoric economies, as fodder or for and Our paper will present the recent results obtained by the archaeobotanical study conducted at Ayios Tychonas – Klimonas, situated in the southern part of Cyprus and dated to the late 9 th and early 8 th millennia BC. The discovery and excavation by a French team (dir. J.-D. Vigne and F. Briois) of an early Holocene village showing cultural affinities with the continental Near East raise questions about the adaptation to insular environments and different aspects of the exploitation and use of plant and animal species. Special attention will be given to evidence of the early cultivation of cereals and the use of different resources from locally growing trees. This paper presents the results of the recent re-examination of the osteological material from Ceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in Limassol district, Cyprus. Stable isotope analyses and paleopathological observations were employed in order to directly reconstruct everyday activities and economic strategies on the island. Archaeological research on Neolithic and Chalcolithic Cyprus has revealed a habitation pattern where permanent agropastoral settlements coexist with semi-permanent camp sites associated with hunting. However, the effect of this economic model on human diets has not been explored, owing largely to the poor preservation of organic material recorded for the island. Our results demonstrate a difference in diet with other agropastoral communities, while the osteological observations show the potential to investigate daily activities through markers on the bones. Lastly, the problem of organic preservation due to the climatic circumstances of the island is addressed, with the aim to put forward a new agenda for future bioarchaeological research in Cyprus. In the current literature Middle Bronze Age (MBA) communities in Cyprus are viewed as small-scale, isolated and agrarian, with a low level of internal socioeconomic differentiation and few inter-site differences. Recent research is challenging this one-size-fits-all approach and beginning to reveal the complexity and diversity of ‘everyday lives’. It is now clear that there were significant differences in site size, with larger sett","The economic valuation of ecosystem services has promoted awareness from within the society to both the ecological and economic consequences of biodiversity loss. This has emerged with reference to the debate about its usefulness. This study, however, reviewed the concept of ecosystem services as a discourse within its metaphor about human dependence on the natural world. Some literature, reports or strategic plans, historical archives and websites were reviewed to conduct the sociopolitical analysis of the institutionalization of the concept in the prior review. It depicts specifically the context of the local communities’ movement to value the natural capital at the Lewes area, East Sussex, England as part of the programs to decouple ‘green payment’ from agricultural sector. Based on the collected evidences, this research argues, there have been a similar pattern of the institutional settings towards the environmental protections between changes related to agricultural pressures and urban pressures. Finally, it can be concluded that, the discourse of ecosystem services using the economic valuation process has also been shaped by the elite capture.","Urbanisation and associated anthropogenic activities release large quantities of toxic metals and metalloids into the environment, where they may bioaccumulate and threaten both wildlife and human health. In highly transformed landscapes, terrestrial carnivores may be at increased risk of exposure through biomagnification. We quantified metallic element and metalloid exposure in blood of caracals (Caracal caracal), an adaptable felid inhabiting the rapidly urbanising, coastal metropole of Cape Town, South Africa. Using redundancy analysis and mixed-effect models, we explored the influence of demography, landscape use, and diet on the concentration of 11 metals and metalloids. Although species-specific toxic thresholds are lacking, arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) were present at potentially sublethal levels in several individuals. Increased use of human-transformed landscapes, particularly urban areas, roads, and vineyards, was significantly associated with increased exposure to aluminium (Al), cobalt (Co) and lead (Pb). Foraging closer to the coast and within aquatic food webs was associated with increased levels of mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and arsenic, where regular predation on seabirds and waterbirds likely facilitates transfer of metals from aquatic to terrestrial food webs. Further, several elements were linked to lower haemoglobin levels (chromium, mercury, manganese, and zinc) and elevated levels of infection-fighting cells (mercury and selenium). Our results highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities as major environmental sources of metal contamination in terrestrial wildlife, including exposure across the land-ocean continuum. These findings contribute towards the growing evidence suggesting cities are particularly toxic areas for wildlife. Co-exposure to a suite of metal pollutants may threaten the long-term health and persistence of Cape Town's caracal population in unexpected ways, particularly when interacting with additional known pollutant and pathogen exposure. The caracal is a valuable sentinel for assessing metal exposure and can be used in pollution monitoring programmes to mitigate exposure and promote biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.","Bushmanship: the explorers' silent partner J.M.R. Cameron,L McLaren &amp; W. Cooper Bushmanship, or the competence to interact meaningfully with newly encountered environments in the achievement of predetermined goals, is a factor overlooked in analyses of land-based exploration. The importance of bushmanship is examined in this paper through a comparison of George Grey's inept exploration of north-western Australia in 183637 with Edward Eyre's increasingly successful overlanding ventures in south-eastern Australia at approximately the same time. Grey's impetuosity, inexperience and lack of competence contrast sharply with Eyre's growing confidence to handle unfamiliar conditions. The comparison reveals many of the factors that differentiate externally initiated expeditions such as Grey's from forays by settlers determined to wrest a living from newly settled territories. Australian Geographer, Vol. 30, No. 3, Nov, 1999 Exploitation or 'Wise Use' of the Coongie Lakes, South Australia: issues arising from a petroleum exploration proposal T. Jenkin The exploitation of natural resources within areas that are valued for their environmental qualities raises competing emotions. This paper considers a proposal to under-take petroleum exploration in an area of recognised environmental value, namely, the Coongie Lakes of far north-ease South Australia. In development cases such as this, the level of inquiry needs to address environmental, social, cultural and economic issues such as this, the level of inquiry needs to be address environmental, social, cultural and economic issues from a range of interest groups; therefore, the process of assessment is a crucial factor in minimising conflict and meeting the wishes of the stakeholders. In the example of Coongie Lakes, the chosen method failed. This paper discusses the perspectives of the major stake holders, the process of assessment undertaken, and the criticisms directed at this process. The apparent inadequacies of the assessment process undertaken are then highlighted, and an alternative assessment procedure suggested. Australian Geographer, Vol. 30, No. 3, Nov, 1999 Community, Place and Cyberspace DJ. Walmsley It is over 30 years since the concept of community without propinquity was first proposed. According to this concept, communities might be spatially far-flung, but nevertheless close-knit, imtimate and held together by shared interests and values, rather than by geographical proximity. Although the idea of community without propinquity has been heavily criticised, the advent of advanced telecommunications and the emergence of cyberspace mean that a reappraisal of the concept, and of the changing nature of community generally, is warranted. The paper undertakes such a reappraisal. A review of the literature on cyberspace reveals several reasons why the social effects of advanced telecommunications and 56 THE AUSTRALIAN SURVEYOR Vol. 45 No. 1 the Internet might be less than is sometimes predicted. Setting this discussion in the context of other social science discourses on new urbanism, consumption rarther than production as a basis for city life, postmodernism, and 'the third way' in politics, shows that place and local community are, and will continue to be, fundamental to the functioning of society. Cyberspace might have annihilated distance but not place. Australian Geographer, Vol. 31, No. 1, March 2000 Coastal Changes Over the Past 200 Years Around Ovalau and Moturiki Islands, Fiji: implications for coastal zone management P.D. Nunn The islands Ovalau and Moturiki in central Fiji are selected for the investigation of coastal change over the past c.200 years. Although having coastal environments typical of many tropical Pacific Islands, Ovalau and Moturiki are also atypical because they experienced urban and infrastructural developments before most other parts. The associated records enable recent coastal changes to be discerned more clearly here than has been possible elsewhere. The islands are surrounded by coral reef, the configuration of which accounts for variations in vulnerability of their coasts to erosion. Interviews were conducted in each of 22 settlements along the islands' coasts and information obtained about recent coastal change. Mangroves are concentrated along leeward coasts, although they have been cleared from many windward coasts in the last 40+ years, causing shoreline erosion to be initiated/accelerated. Most shoreline-protection initiatives (vegetation planting and seawall construction) have failed. Three major management implications of the study are discussed. Firstly, there is a need to redefine the nature of the interactions between coastal inhabitants and coastal ecosystems, so that environments are sustainably developed; and specially that reefs are conserved and shoreline vegetation (especially mangroves) is effectively replanted. Secondly, information about appropriate design and composition of artificial structures for shoreline protection needs to be made available to the local communities who construct most of them. Thirdly, alternative sources of sand and rock aggregate to those whose extraction aggravates shoreline erosions should be sought. Australian Geographer, Vol. 31, No. 1, March 2000 A Late Holocene Vegetation and Environment Record from Byenup Lagoon, South-western Australia J.R. Dodson &amp; J.J. Lu South-western Australia has a Mediterranean-type climate and its infertile soils support a highly diverse angiosperm flora. Little is known of the vegetation history of this region, and this means that little can be said of the roles of environmental stability, climate change, or human impact on the maintenance or development of the high biodiversity of the region. This study presents a pollen and fossil charcoal record from two peat profiles from a freshwater lagoon region near Lake Muir, east of Munjimup, in south-western Australia. The record shows a glimpse of an early Holocene where a mix of Casuarina and eucalypts with an understorey of health and some open herbaceous vegetation, including chenopods, occurred. Fire was not an important factor at this THE AUSTRALIAN SURVEYOR Vol. 45 No. 1 time. The main record begins from about 4800 BP, and shows a vegetation mix of Corymbia calophylla and Eucalyptus marginata, with the latter becoming dominant by about 3500 BP. Corymbia calophylla again becomes prominent in the last few centuries. A healthy understorey is present thoughout the last 4800 years, but was apparently less dense during phases when C. calophylla was more prominent. Melaleuca woodland has been the main vegetation type around the wetland areas and areas of inundation since the rnid-Holocene. Major fire periods at Byenup, around 4200 BP and between about 3000 and 2000 BP, did not result in major vegetation changes. An analysis of cation content in the sediments suggests that weathering and erosion rates have been relatively stable throughout the record, but an increase in phosphorus and possibly organic matter in the surface layers suggests that agricultural practices have led to changes in the chemistry of sediments. It is hypothesised that and increase in effective precipitation about 4800 BP led to the initiation of the continuous part of the sediment record at Byenup. This increase most likely resulted from a more effective westerly wind stream. Changes since this time are more likely a result of changing fire regime and the interaction of species, rather than climate shifts. Australian Geographer, Vol. 31, No. 1, March 2000 City vs Country: the demise of the brewing industry in country New South Wales, c.1898-1932 B.J. Stubbs At the end of the 1880s, eight in ten breweries in the colony of New South Wales were located in country (nonmetropolitan) areas, and these accounted for about 25 per cent of total colonial beer production. The number of country breweries experienced a dramatic decline after the 1880s, reaching only two by 1932. This process occurred in the three more-or-less discrete states: until about 1900, when internal restructuring reduced the number from about 65 to about 40; a decade or two after 1900 when, facilitated by the Sydney-centred railway network. city competition further reduced the number; and a period, mainly in the 1920s, typified by takeovers of country by city breweries. Additionally, the elimination of border duties after Federation introduced Melbourne competition to brewers in the southern part of the State.

This paper reports on the results of a case study undertaken in the lower Herbert River catchment in northeast Queensland, which utilisied remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assess both spatial and temporal changes in land cover since European settlment in the mid-nineteenth century. We demonstrate that since European settlement there has been a substantial reduction in the area of Melaleuca, rainforest, and eucalyptus-dominated land-cover patterns. We also provide a range of quantitative measures to show that the landscape diversity, integrity and Abstracts JUNE 2000 quality of these ecosystems have also declined between the 1860s and 1996.

Knowing the physical and natural elements of the Amazon and the processes of interdependence between them allows us to discover the landscape and think about sustainable strategies for the region. Higher education institutions and several research institutes located in the Amazon, Brazil and around the world produce diverse research on the Amazon region. But do these results reach our Basic Education students or are they forming a generation that is unaware of the complexity of the relationships between the physical and natural elements of the Brazilian Amazon? The main objective of the research is to analyze the students' perception of the natural-physical elements of the Amazon and as secondary objectives: to identify the students' perception of the natural-physical elements, to verify whether the interactions between the natural-physical elements are understood by the students, to identify the difficulties and challenges that the teachers of Geography have in creating an environment conducive to learning the naturalphysical contents and to verify how the textbook and the curriculum influence the approach to the natural-physical elements of the Amazon in Geography classes. A qualitative methodological approach of an exploratory-explanatory nature was favored, based on a bibliographical and documentary review and subsequent application of a questionnaire to 50 teachers and 147 students from Elementary School II of the municipal school system of the city of Manaus (AM). The collected data were classified through the guidance of the Content Analysis. In summary, students are unable to describe the physical picture of the Amazon, do not have a sophisticated perception of the region, and have difficulties in analyzing the web of relationships between the natural physical elements, especially, rocks, relief and soil, which correspond to the same elements that teachers point out as the least content domain. With regard to rivers, climate and vegetation there is a greater familiarity, although there is a need to improve the concepts. Of the physical elements, the one of greater knowledge for the students was the vegetation, but this knowledge is superficial and refers only to the tree vegetation, untouched. Contributing to this perception are the little contextualization of the diversity of the Amazon in classes and the fact that the research was conducted in a school located in the urban area of Manaus, a regional metropolis, highly urbanized, industrial, weakly wooded that differs totally from the image widely disseminated by the mass media that always give greater prominence to the forest. Because of this, the forest is the physical element most present in the students' records. This diagnosis of how the Amazon is perceived by the students who live in it can contribute to outline teaching guidelines, so that the Amazon students can rework their knowledge about the region, understand and establish geographic knowledge to understand the interaction society / nature and exercise the interest and spirit of investigation and problem solving, establishing connections between the different themes of geographic knowledge, valuing the formation of conscious and participatory citizens.","\n &lt;p&gt;An urban world population of 0.75 billion in 1950 and expected 6 billion in 2050 shows the tremendous potential growth of urban areas. The urban soil fulfills the role of the reactor for the physical, chemical and biological transformations of matter but also covers such functions as reduction of air pollution, regulation of climate elements in cities, source of biodiversity and formation of areas for ornamental and recreation purposes. As a usual part of urban ecosystems, urban soils in general have high concentrations of trace elements derive from human activities. The objectives of this work were (1) to quantify the concentrations and establish background levels of Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni, V and Zn in soils of Coronel city; (2) to assess the degree of pollution and identify local sources of pollution and (3) to assess the health risks of TE in soils of Coronel city. From Coronel city were collected 129 samples from 43 sites located in schoolyards and playground areas. At each sampling point were taken three samples: topsoil sample (TS) (0-10 cm), subsoil sample (SS) (10-20 cm) and deep soil sample (DS) (150 cm). Multivariate statistical analysis and depth ratios were used to distinguish the source. Ecological indices were implemented to evaluate the degree of contamination. The median and (range) of the trace elements (TE) in TS were Ba 38 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (12-147 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), 38 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Co 4-40 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; 15 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Cr 10-35 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 18 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Cu 12-70 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 22 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Mn 167-950 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 536 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Ni 11-115 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 35.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Pb 1.5-115 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 6 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; V 52-528 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 94 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; Zn 42-373 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 65 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Depth ratios and multivariate statistical analysis suggested that Co, Ni and Mn have principal contribution of geogenic sources and Ba, Cr, Cu, Pb, V and Zn anthropogenic sources. The upper limit of background values estimated with median absolute deviation (MAD) method and DS samples were Ba 30 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Co 24 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Cr 22 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Cu 24 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Mn 662 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Ni 66 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;Pb 1.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;V 108 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;#160;and Zn 52 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Contamination factor showed that some soil sample were categorized as considerable contamination to very high contamination for Pb, Zn and V.

In this study, I focused on disturbance due to agriculture and cattle grazing by measuring arthropod community composition between two disturbed and two less-disturbed sites in northwestern Montana, USA. The disturbed sites included cattle plots and a wheat field, while the lessdisturbed sites included a montane forest and a mixed-grass prairie. At each of these sites, I sampled four subsites using a combination of pitfall and light traps, two nights for each subsite, for a total of 32 light trap jars and 128 pitfall traps collected. For each sample, I identified all arthropods to family using a dissecting microscope. I conducted multi-way ANOVAs to test for differences between sites in terms of arthropod abundance, family richness, Shannon’s diversity, and family evenness for pitfall and light traps. I also chose several more common groups of arthropods to compare between sites, using ANOVAs as well. For pitfall traps, I found arthropod abundance, family richness, and diversity to be significantly different among sites, with sites showing a variety of contrasts. For light traps, I found diversity and family evenness to be different among sites, again with an array of contrasts. The Formicidae and Araneae families were shown to have significantly different abundances between site as well; many Formicidae were found in a more disturbed ecosystem, and greater Araneae abundance was noted in less disturbed ecosystems. As predicted, arthropod family diversity was greater in the forest site. However, diversity was low at the bison range, likely due to less soil moisture. The farm field demonstrated surprisingly high family richness and diversity, and this was likely due to soil moisture as well, as the field received high levels of irrigation. The cattle plots were not very diverse, but had high overall abundance which may have been linked to lack of predators or low plant diversity. INTRODUCTION Human-mediated disturbance is any modification to an ecosystem by a person or group of people. Human disturbance manifests in a variety of ways, from fire to agriculture to creating fields for cattle grazing. It has also been known to cause a number of negative effects in ecosystems, including a decrease in biodiversity. Disturbance strongly affects aspects of species diversity, as found in a large number of studies (Mackey and Currie 2001). In this study I focused on monoculture agriculture and cattle grazing as forms of disturbance. Arthropods provide a multitude of ecosystem services such as aiding in decomposition, pest control, and pollination (Isaacs et al. 2008). Therefore, greater arthropod diversity generally positively affects ecosystems. Arthropod community composition is used as an indicator of the level of disturbance in a landscape. Arthropods are also ideal study organisms, as they are numerous and easy to capture. In a meta-study of many papers investigating disturbance, arthropod richness was found to be significantly higher in areas of less intensive land use (Attwood et al. 2008). Arthropods can also be used as indicators of biodiversity and to pinpoint the relative quality of an ecosystem. Some arthropods are generalists found in many habitats in an area, and these are commonly called cosmopolitan or urban taxa. Others are specialists found in only a few less disturbed places or near a specific plant species, and they are called indicator taxa. For this study, I hypothesized that greater arthropod family richness and diversity would be found in the less disturbed habitats that I sampled, the bison range and the forest, for both pitfall and light traps. Conversely, I predicted that less richness and diversity would exist in the cattle plots and farm field, the two more disturbed sites. I was also measuring abundance, but did not think that it would be related to disturbance, because species can maintain the same relative abundance in a range of conditions (Gaston and Warren 1997). Finally, I expected that the presence of some families or groups of families would be correlated with a more or less disturbed habitat type, as this is commonly found in studies similar to mine. METHODS Location. This study was conducted in July and August 2013 in a broad array of four sites including two disturbed and two largely non-disturbed habitat types in northwestern Montana (N 47 ̊25’, W 114 ̊18’). The less-disturbed sites included a montane Douglas fir forest and a small section of mixed-grass prairie within the National Bison Range. The disturbed sites included a grazed cattle plot area and a monoculture wheat field (Figure 1). Collection. For each of the four habitat types, four subsites within 100 yards of each other were chosen. In each of these sites, four pitfall traps and one light trap were installed. The light traps were constructed of a lantern attached to a tripod above a large funnel connected to a jar filled with an alcohol and water mixture. The light trap was suspended a few feet above the ground to attract flying arthropods. At each subsite, pitfall traps and light traps were installed in the afternoon or evening and left overnight. All arthropods were collected the next morning and stored in a freezer until they could be identified (see below). Each of the subsites was assayed for two nights of trapping total, and eight pitfalls traps and two light trap jars were collected per subsite. Overall, 32 light trap jars and 128 pitfall traps were collected over twelve nights of survey. Identification. For each of the light trap jars and pitfall traps, all arthropods were counted and identified to family under a dissecting microscope. 55 families from the light traps and 54 families from the pitfall traps were separated and counted. Because many Collembola were found in most samples, I chose to record them as 100+ individuals, rather than count them all, because their abundances were not very important due to being so high in nearly every pitfall trap. Analysis. To analyze the data after identification, I used a variety of indices coupled with multi-way ANOVA’s and post-hoc Tukey tests to determine differences between sites for pitfall traps and light traps. These included counts and calculations of total arthropod abundance per trap, family richness per site, Shannon’s diversity, and family evenness. I also chose some families and groups of families found throughout all the sites and that are commonly surveyed in similar studies, including the families Cicadellidae and Formicidae, and the orders Lepidoptera and Araneae. RESULTS Pitfall traps. For pitfall traps, abundance of arthropods between sites was significantly different (Figure 2; F3,12=4.707, p=0.021). Collembola counts were removed because their numbers had been great in all sites, so they played almost no part in creating differences between the four ecosystems. In a Tukey’s HSD test, significantly more individual arthropods were caught at the cattle plot site than the bison range (p=0.018) and forest (p=0.076) sites. Family richness was significantly different among habitat types (Figure 3; F3,12=2.8795, p=0.080). However, none of the sites were significantly different from one another when tested side by side. Shannon’s diversity index was also significantly different among sites (Figure 4; F3,12=4.38889, p=0.026). In comparison of means, forest had a significantly higher diversity index than cattle plots (p=0.018). From the Shannon index, family evenness was calculated, but was not significant for pitfall traps between any sites (F3,11=1.183, p=0.361). Light traps. For light traps, abundance of arthropods and family richness was did not differ significantly among sites (F3,12=0.578, p=0.641, and F3,12=2.300, p=0.130, respectively). The Shannon’s diversity index was also calculated for light traps. Significant differences existed between sites (Figure 5; F3,12=3.9034, p=0.037). Specifically, the forest was more diverse than the bison range (p=0.051) and the farm field (p=0.062). Though the sites did not have significantly different family evenness for pitfall traps, they did for light traps (Figure 6; F3,12=4.03, p=0.034); the cattle plot sites had much lower family evenness than forest and bison range sites. Taxa comparisons. After basic indices of overall community composition were analyzed, a few families and groups of families that were determined to be important were chosen for comparison between the four major sites. Cicadellidae and Formicidae were two of the largest families found in pitfall traps at all sites, and their abundances were considered in evaluating the differences between sites. For Cicadellidae, differences between sites were not significant (F3,12=2.580, p=0.102). But for Formicidae, abundances were significantly different in the four ecosystems (Figure 7, F3,12=8.1686, p=0.003). The cattle plots had a significantly higher number of Formicidae than the bison range (p=0.004), the farm field (p=0.011), and the forest (p=0.012). Finally, a few larger groups of families and orders were analyzed. Though Lepidoptera catch rates were larger in light traps, they did not indicate a significant different between sites. Araneae abundances, on the other hand, were different between the four ecosystems in pitfall traps (Figure 8, F3,12=4.7724, p=0.021). While quite a few Araneae were found in the forest, none were found in farm field pitfall traps. The specific differences found in Araneae communities were between the farm field and bison range (p=0.059) and the farm field and forest (p=0.019). DISCUSSION Results showed that in general, a complex mixture of contrasts existed between the four habitat types when abundance, family richness, Shannon’s diversity, and family evenness were measured for pitfall and light traps. Pitfall traps. For pitfall traps, overall abundance was significantly higher in the cattle plots than in the bison range and forest. It was also interesting to find ","Currently, fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas represent the prime energy sources in the world. However, it is anticipated that these sources of energy will deplete within the next 40–50 years. Moreover, the expected environmental damages such as the global warming, acid rain and urban smog due to the production of emissions from these sources have tempted the world to try to reduce carbon emissions by 80% and shift towards utilizing a variety of renewable energy resources (RES) which are less environmentally harmful such as solar, wind, biomass etc. in a sustainable way. Biomass is one of the earliest sources of energy with very specific properties. In this review, several aspects which are associated with burning biomass in boilers have been investigated such as composition of biomass, estimating the higher heating value of biomass, comparison between biomass and other fuels, combustion of biomass, cofiring of biomass and coal, impacts of biomass, economic and social analysis of biomass, transportation of biomass, densification of biomass, problems of biomass and future of biomass. It has been found that utilizing biomass in boilers offers many economical, social and environmental benefits such as financial net saving, conservation of fossil fuel resources, job opportunities creation and CO2 and NOx emissions reduction. However, care should be taken to other environmental impacts of biomass such as land and water resources, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and deforestation. Fouling, marketing, low heating value, storage and collections and handling are all associated problems when burning biomass in boilers. The future of biomass in boilers depends upon the development of the markets for fossil fuels and on policy decisions regarding the biomass market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, flooding may disturb road functionality and generate direct and indirect adverse impacts, including the loss of access to essential services. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of flood impacts on road network topology and accessibility to amenities for major communities in the State of Iowa using graph-theoretic methods, including single-source shortest path analyses. We assessed the disruption of transportation networks on the accessibility to critical amenities (e.g., hospitals) under 100 and 500-year flood scenarios. Our analysis methodology leads toward the development of an integrated real-time decision support system that will allow decisionmakers to explore “what if” flood scenarios to identify vulnerable areas and population in their authority. Due to locations and effects on road topology under flood events, the results show differential impacts in access to critical services.

Introduction The effects of flooding can be devastating in terms of scope and effect, including loss of lives, adverse economic and financial impacts, and increased uncertainty regarding the normal function of communities. In the U.S., no place is immune to flooding, and about 99% of U.S. counties have been impacted by flooding (FEMA, 2020). Due to climate change, population growth, and urban development, flooding will continue to occur more often with severe consequences (Sadler et al., 2017). According to the National Weather Service, in the United States, the average annual effects of flooding lead to approximately 100 deaths and $8 billion in flood-related damages. The State of Iowa has experienced many flood disasters that have affected its people, infrastructure, and agriculture over the last two decades (Yildirim &amp; Demir, 2019). For example, the 2008 flood affected more than 40,000 people and caused over $10 billion in estimated damage across the State (Zogg, 2014). Recently, Iowa experienced a flood event in 2019 along the Missouri River and elsewhere across the state with estimated damage of $1.6 Billion (Iowa.gov, 2019). Change in native tallgrass to agricultural production is contributing to the scope and magnitude of flood effects (Gilles et al., 2012). These changes increase water flow on the surface, and existing drainage channels may not be able to hold the increased flow. In addition, soil conditions and topography contribute to flooding by increasing runoff velocity and decreasing infiltration. Floods can significantly impact a community and prevent critical facilities such as police stations and fire departments from providing services (FEMA, 2015). During flood events, people requiring treatment may have to travel to hospitals or outpatient services. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the critical facilities at risk of flooding and how changing conditions alter their accessibility. Floods can prevent hospitals from operating efficiently and consistently. For example, during the 2008 flood in Iowa, the Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids was submerged, and 183 patients were evacuated (Ware, 2013). Moreover, to have an effective response to flooding, it is important to study the accessibility of emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance) to residential areas before and after a flood event. Some people are more concerned about their properties during floods while ignoring the importance of road operation (Ensor, 2019). When a road is flooded, the effects of its closure can cascade throughout the network system and affect people, businesses, emergency response, and traffic capacity. For example, a school bus may not be able to access an area because of inundated roads. Also, flooded roads may prevent people from obtaining essential supplies (e.g., food) or reaching their work. This may cause emotional distress and losses in work hours and GDP (Botzen et al., 2019). In addition, disruption of road networks may make emergency evacuation impossible. It is critical for flood disaster management to assess transportation networks under dynamic disaster conditions in real-time using information technologies. Flood risk management and disaster mitigation have been studied extensively in recent years using real-time and integrated information frameworks. These cyber systems can benefit from automated (Sermet et al., 2020) and structured data integration (Sermet &amp; Demir, 2019b; Demir &amp; Szczepanek, 2017), and volunteer computing infrastructures (Agliamzanov et al., 2020). Transportation analysis under flood conditions is a critical component of such information and decision support systems to support the public and decision-makers on flood-related planning and mitigation. Information and knowledge generated through data-driven models (Sit &amp; Demir, 2019; Xiang et al., 2020) can be communicated to end-users via visualization systems (Seo et al., 2019; Sermet &amp; Demir, 2019a) for flooding. In our study, we analyzed the vulnerability of all road classes during a 100 year and 500-year flood events in Iowa and the effects of flooding on road network topology and accessibility to essential services provided by hospitals, police, and fire departments. Our research focuses on relative travel distances to amenities under no flood, 100-year, and 500-year flood scenarios. This analytical method provides an overall assessment of the road system, including potential improvements on road design to respond to flood events and enhancing flood risk management. We used an increase in travel distances due to flood-related road closures as the comparison metric to evaluate the impact of flood conditions on the road network. The paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 provides a review of studies related to flood impacts on routing systems and emergency services. The research methodology for integrating transportation networks and flood models to assess and analyze the road vulnerability and accessibility for cities in Iowa, including bridge operation conditions, is presented under section 2. Section 3 presents the results and effects of flood damage analysis on transportation networks. Discussions and conclusions follow these sections. 1. Background Floods can severely impact infrastructure in rural and urban environments. Urbanization, heavy rains, and river or stream overflow can lead to flooding (Zhang et al., 2018). Also, soil conditions and topography of an area contribute to increased flood risk (Cunha et al., 2011). Floods can occur as a result of human-made causes. For example, poor infrastructure design increases the probability of experiencing a devastating flood event. Even though flooding can happen whenever and in any zone, some areas and seasons are associated with an increased likelihood of flooding (Ruslan et al.,2014). It is necessary to develop plans for mitigating the adverse impacts of flooding through preparation and changes to infrastructure. Flood impacts can be addressed through structural and non-structural techniques (Tingsanchali, 2012). Structural methods such as water management systems (e.g., dams) contribute to control and manage floodwater movement. However, these may introduce other issues, including changes to water flow and increased biodiversity losses (Wu et al., 2004). On the other hand, moving people from the flooded area to a safe shelter is an example of non-structural mitigation (Tingsanchali, 2012). These methods can also introduce issues due to equity and cost concerns. The need for sustainable flood mitigation management practices is essential to protect people, infrastructure, economy, transportation, and agriculture. Previous research has contributed to flood mitigation including role of homeowners(e.g., constructing floodwalls on the property) (Laska, 1986), adaption and mitigation techniques for agriculture (Arbuckle et al., 2013), preventing power system blackouts exposed to extreme weather (Dou et al., 2015), strategies to improve floodwater quality (Nicholson et al., 2012), and decision support systems with serious gaming (Carson et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Sermet et al., 2020). Transportation networks are one of the essential infrastructures for the functioning of a society and economy (Guze, 2014). These networks may experience adverse impacts, including floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks affecting their performance, efficiency, and accessibility (Dehghani et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2019). Decisions about the placement of shelters, temporary services, and potential evacuation routes must be made within the context of current and predicted flood extents and scopes. Research on route-finding and navigation during dynamic events has approached these issues in many ways. Researchers have published studies related to optimal evacuation strategies, such as determining safe evacuee routes (Campos et al., 2012; Goerigk et al., 2014), reaching the shelters from flood inundated areas using a legislative time (Borowska-Stefańska et al., 2017), determining evacuation routes that minimize the evacuation time (Bayram and Yaman, 2017; Zhao et al., 2016), and location-allocation of shelters (Kongsomsaksakul et al., 2005). Other researchers focus on routing systems for emergency services (e.g., police and deliveries of essential goods) during emergency situations (Jotshi et al., 2009; Campbell et al., 2008; Mali et al., 2012; Özdamar &amp; Demir, 2012). In addition, planning evacuation routes are a chal","Changes in ecology, climate and human behaviour over recent decades have favoured the development and increased prevalence of urban pests, including nuisance insects. The potential for nuisance insect species to increase in prevalence in the UK as a result of climate change is addressed in this report through two key objectives: 1: To complete a desk top study to determine the current level of knowledge in relation to new and existing species of insect with the potential to cause statutory nuisance in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change 2: To investigate the potential for new and existing species of insect to cause statutory nuisance to occur in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change In the first section of this report we consider the first objective and present an inventory of nuisance insects and discuss the availability of information on these species to Environmental Health Officers (EHOs). We conclude from this section that defining an insect as a statutory nuisance should be on a case-by-case basis; an insect will be a statutory nuisance in some scenarios but not others (particularly in relation to the source and abundance of the insects). In addition, we focus on two subsidiary objectives: 3. To devise a programme or technique for monitoring trends in the insects of most concern 4 To devise a list of strategies that Environmental Health Officers can apply locally and disseminate to residents. We comment on the wealth of literature and information on nuisance insect species but note the lack of a central information source for EHOs and other interested parties. We suggest that a central repository would be a valuable tool for EHO‟s particularly if it included fact sheets (providing relevant biological information for EHO‟s) and distribution maps. We advocate the use of the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway as a resource for providing distribution data but discuss the current limitations in terms of available data. We have appended example fact sheets for a number of species. \nIn the second section of this report we consider nuisance insects more broadly than encompassed in the statutory nuisance definition, and provide examples of species that have \n6 \nalready been recorded in Britain (native and non-native including residents and occasional immigrants) or are potential invaders (non-native new arrivals). The methods used to review the literature on nuisance insects species and the impacts of climate change on their distribution, in a systematic way, are described. We highlight the nuisance insect species that are unlikely to be affected by climate warming Blattella germanica (german cockroach), Cimex lectularius (bed bug), Monomorium pharaonis (Pharaoh‟s ant), Anobium punctatum (woodworm), Ctenocephalides felis (cat fleas), Lyctus brunneus (powderpost beetle), Hylotrupes bajulus (house longhorn), Tineola bisselliella (common clothes moth), Dolichovespula media (media wasp) and Vespa crabro (European hornet). The ten species most likely to increase with climate warming are Tinearia alternata (moth fly), Lasius neglectus (invasive garden ant), Thaumetopoea processionea (oak processionary moth), Linepithema humile (Argentine ant), Reticulitermes grassei (Mediterranean termite), Culex pipiens molestus (urban mosquito), Culex pipiens pipiens (mosquito), Aedes vexans (mosquito – wetland), Ochlerotatus cantans (mosquito – woodland) and Musca domestica (house fly). The ten species most likely to increase with changes in precipitation are the same as for increasing temperature with the exception of Musca domestica and inclusion of Phlebotomus mascittii (sand fly). We provide two detailed case studies illustrating potential modelling approaches: biting midges and mosquitoes. In addition, we highlight the potential for further studies which would enable detailed quantitative analysis, such as demonstrated in the case studies, to be undertaken across taxa.","Landscape structure and spatial pattern are the core issues in landscape ecology. The application of graph theory provides a research framework for landscape pattern analysis. Landscape graph based on graph theory is gradually applied to the connectivity modeling of biodiversity conservation and decision support of landscape planning. The representation, analysis and application of landscape graph have become a hot topic in conservation biology and landscape ecology. In this review, we first introduced the graph theory basis of landscape map. Based on the Scopus database, 257 published journal papers with the words \"landscape graph\", \"connectivity\" and \"network\" in titles, abstracts, and keywords from 1993 to 2019 were retrieved. We analyzed the research progress and development trend of this field from the aspects of annual published papers, journal sources, research areas, research institutions and landscape types involved. The results showed that before 2017, the number of journal papers published showed an overall increasing trend, and after 2017, the annual number of published papers decreased year by year. The main research forces were concentrated in United States, France, Canada, and China, contributing to 86.8% of the total published papers. Most of the research results were published in \"Landscape Ecology\", \"Landscape and Urban Planning\", and \"Biological Conservation\". In the research content, the representation of landscape graph mainly included the definition of nodes, the measurement of edges and the simulation of landscape. The analysis of landscape graph involved analysis index and landscape graph partitioning. This study mainly focused on the application of landscape graph in science and practice, including biodiversity conservation, landscape (ecological network) planning and management, the assessment of landscape impacts. Landscape graph based on graph theory influences conservation science and planning practitioners by helping understand landscape connectivity changes, animal behavior and habitat conservation. The impact of graph theory on conservation science and planning comes from the rich theoretical basis and mature research methods. Landscape graph based on graph theory provides a springboard for ecological understanding of landscape structure and pattern, and is an important tool for global researchers and practitioners.","Mangroves are tropical ecosystems with strategic importance for climate change mitigation on local and global scales. They are also under considerable threat due to fragmentation degradation and urbanization. However, a complete understanding of how anthropogenic actions can affect microbial biodiversity and functional adaptations is still lacking. In this study, we carried out 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis using sediment samples from two distinct mangrove areas located within the Serinhaém Estuary, Brazil. The first sampling area was located around the urban area of Ituberá, impacted by domestic sewage and urban runoff, while the second was an environmentally conserved site. Our results show significant changes in the structure of the communities between impacted and conserved sites. Biodiversity, along with functional potentials for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, were significantly increased in the urban area. We found that the environmental factors of organic matter, temperature and copper were significantly correlated with the observed shifts in the communities. Contributions of specific taxa to the functional potentials were negatively correlated with biodiversity, such that fewer numbers of taxa in the conserved area contributed to the majority of the metabolic potential. The results suggest that the contamination by urban runoff may have generated a different environment that led to the extinction of some taxa observed at the conserved site. In their place we found that the impacted site is enriched in prokaryotic families that are known human and animal pathogens, a clear negative effect of the urbanization process.","As human populations in the urban areas increase, demand for housing grow and urbanization and industrialization intensify .Consequently, there is increased surface runoff causing sedimentation and eutrophication and untimely deterioration of water quality ,habitats, and the biodiversity .This trend requires integrated and sustainable urban planning strategies. This project presents a synthesis of the potential and challenges of existing variations in the atmospheric variables in Nairobi city as an urban environment. The data set used in this study was the monthly air temperature for the selected stations for the period of 30 years .The data utilized was from Wilson Airport, JKIA and Dagoretti corner. The variables of the study were relative humidity, Rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperatures and wind roses over Nairobi. Actually Nairobi city is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and therefore it is necessary to study its the moisture field due to its impacts on the buildings, aviation industries among the others. This study looked at the long -term modifications of the annual conditions of surface temperatures, rainfall and the relative humidity .The rainfall and humidity trends showed an increasing trend. The increase in temperatures in the city makes it to be warmer than its environs causing a condition called the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Alot of challenges seem to threaten the sustainable developments in cities. Such challenges include lack of awareness in planning, legislation, financial, technical and institutional resources as well as luck of crucial data and information about the state of the city environment. The methods used in the analysis included the time series analysis, lagged correlation analysis, Analysis of variance and the ratio of the goodness of fit.","Women are disadvantaged across all stages of academic publishing. In science, contribution to editorial boards of journals is evidence of a high reputation within a specialty or field. Therefore, the low presence of women on editorial boards can be considered a disadvantage indicator for women in academia. This study aims to highlight the gap in women’s contributions in land science journals. We assessed the gender composition of editorial boards in 60 peer-reviewed journals using systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and we obtained data on current and past editorial boards of these journals. The result shows that the current number of editorial board members is 5197 of which only 25.47 percent are women. Gender inequality is very evident in this group of journals to the extent that journals with a high impact factor indicate inequality that is even more than 75 percent. The results of the time series analysis have also shown that the presence of women on editorial boards has increased over the last decade, although this increase has been more in the Nordic countries. The geographical distribution of editorial board members is also quite unequal in the North and South, 83 percent of female editorial board members are from northern countries, while only 12 percent are from the global South. According to the results, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender equality, especially in the field of land science. Our results also support previous findings of a considerable gender difference in urban land science, geoscience community, biodiversity conservation, and veterinary sciences. Thus, the academic community, editors, and journals must take proactive measures to achieve gender balance.","Oil exploitation in many African countries is associated with litigation and conflicts to water and soil pollution. It is because of inadequate planning for management of oil spills and industrial effluents in environmentally sustainable manner. Uganda’s natural resources such as soils and water bodies are threatened by contamination due to rapid industrialization and rural-urban migration in established Industrial Business Parks and planned oil and gas production at Albertine Graben Region. The low level of compliance to industrial effluents discharge standards relevant to specific environmental receptors and activities within oil and gas sector development pose a big question of how to sustain the biodiversity and natural resource management. Experiences from elsewhere have shown bioremediation as a viable and proven option to provide potentially manageable solutions to resulting pollution as a substitute to modern well-known remediation methods, for it is relatively cheaper, more efficient and minimal toxic byproducts after treatment. The most used bioremediation agents in different studies reviewed are bacterial species especially Pseudomonas and Bacillus, followed by Aspergillus a fungi species, microalgae and aquatic plants such as duckweed, macrophytes and pteridophytes. Regardless of the waste produced in either oil and gas sector or industries, these agents have shown greater biodegradation rates. Pseudomonas sp. has a degradation efficiency of oil compounds ranging from 90% - 100%, and Aspergillus sp. 75% - 95%. Some aquatic plants can thrive in created wetlands with relatively still water such as Phragmites australis which can degrade hydrocarbons especially Aromatic compounds with benzene ring up to 95%. It can thrive in salty water with high pH range of 4.8 - 8.2. With industrial wastewater, algae is the most dominant with the degradation rates varying from 65% -100% and bacteria at 70% - 90%. Most of the reported results are in the developed country context. In developing countries, duckweed is reported as the commonest aquatic plant in wastewater treatment for removal of heavy metals because it is more tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions and produce biomass faster. It has a removal rate of heavy metals between 90% and 100%. Basing on literature data analysis, bacteria are more suitable for treating water from oil pollution using Pseudomonas sp. Phragmites australis is suited for cleaning up oil in both water and soil. Duckweed is the best in treating water polluted with industrial effluents. This paper presents the different bioremediation methods that Uganda can potentially apply to mitigate the increased risk of environmental pollutions from planned industrialization and oil and gas development in the Albertine Graben Region.","Kenya has experienced rapid population growth and urbanization in recent years leading to major changes in its natural environment. Urban infrastructure has a significant influence on carbon emissions and environmental degradation. Urban green spaces are some of the interventions that demonstrate how the impact of increased urbanization can be managed. An exploration of the current state of urban green spaces in Kenya is essential to identify equitable and sustainable development strategies. Kenya has a few green spaces and community gardens for relaxation and recreational activities. These spaces’ continued renovation and preservation strongly indicate Kenya’s commitment to maintaining urban green spaces for a sustainable environment. A multi-method approach involving a literature review, situational analysis, and researchers’ reflections was used to examine two urban green spaces (Nairobi City Park and John Michuki memorial park) and identify their benefits and opportunities to the environment and community whilst highlighting the challenges of maintaining the spaces. Green spaces provide socioeconomic benefits, increased biodiversity, reduced air and water pollution, and regulated temperatures. Population growth, lack of enough public open spaces, and overdevelopment are highlighted as contributors to environmental degradation. Urban green spaces in Kenya offer numerous economic and social development opportunities, promoting employment creation and attracting foreign investment. Today, community centers, such as green libraries, sustain the environment by availing modern reading areas with adequate natural lighting and disseminating knowledge that promotes green growth. It is unclear how renovated Kenyan urban spaces, such as parks, create a better environment and reduce the negative impacts of urbanization. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing an understanding of the role of urban green spaces in Kenya and how they promote environment sustainability.","Ecosystem services are strongly underpinned by ecological processes and functions and influenced by socioeconomics in human-environmental systems. As the prerequisites for human well-being, ecosystem services can reflect the interactions of human and environmental systems. Being pervading the process of ecosystem service assessments, uncertainties should be uncovered and preferably reduced before the assessing results are adopted for the decision-making of regional environmental management. This study explores the interrelationships between ecosystem services and socioeconomic variables at regional scales, develops a methodological framework of uncertainty analysis and applies it to investigate the uncertainties emerged in the assessments of ecosystem services of the study areas. \nChapter 1 provides a brief review of the fields concerning the ecosystem service issues addressed in this thesis. The introduction involves the basic concepts related to ecosystem services, the state of the art of ecosystem service quantification and mapping, the role of ecosystem services in human-environmental systems, ecosystem services’ linkages with socioeconomics as well as the uncertainties in ecosystem service assessments. After uncovering the respective research gaps, this chapter identifies and elucidates the objectives of the study and raises the associated four research questions. \nChapter 2 explores the socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being at the regional scale of Jiangsu, China on the basis of the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) conceptual model. Additionally, the study investigates the quantitative linkages between the five sectors of the DPSIR model. The results show that urbanization and industrialization in the urban areas can have positive influences on regional biodiversity, agricultural productivity, tourism services and rural residents’ living standards. Besides, the knowledge, technology and finance inputs for agriculture have positive impacts on these system components. Concerning regional carbon storage, non-cropland vegetation cover obviously plays a significant positive role. Contrarily, the expansion of farming land and the increase of total food production are two important negative influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystems’ food provisioning capacity, regional tourism income and the well-being of the rural population. Finally, the linkages of the DPSIR sectors in a network pattern are quantitatively evidenced. \nChapter 3 characterizes the urban-rural gradients of ecosystem services and socioeconomics of Leipzig, Germany and Kunming, China. It further quantifies the linkages between the gradients of ecosystem services and socioeconomics and conducts gradient comparisons between different gradient patterns in the two study areas. The chapter ends with the revelation of the uncertainties in creating the gradients. The results show some similar regularities in the spatial patterns of ecosystem services and socioeconomic dimensions in both study areas. Habitat quality and f-evapotranspiration of Leipzig and habitat quality of Kunming demonstrate apparent trends of increases along all gradient patterns. However, the other ecosystem services present divergent spatial variability in different gradient patterns. Road density, urban fabric and population density show identical declining trends in both study areas except for the soaring of population density around the center of Leipzig. Differently, household size, housing area and unemployment rate in Leipzig present inconsistent spatial dynamics with considerable fluctuations. Regarding the gradient interrelations, road density, urban fabric and population density are strongly correlated with most ecosystem service types in both case study areas. In contrast, the gradients of household size, housing area and unemployment rate of Leipzig show inconsistent correlations with the ecosystem services gradients. The introduced uncertainty gradient method shows appropriateness to quantitatively capture the uncertainties in exploring ecosystem services and socioeconomic gradients in urban-rural areas. \nChapter 4 addresses the spatial characteristics of ecosystem services and the respective socioeconomic influences in a heavily human-disturbed watershed in Southwest China. It firstly quantifies and maps five ecosystem services of nine river basins of the Dianchi Lake Watershed. The quantification is based on the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the biophysical and socioeconomic data. Thereafter, a confirmatory research is conducted by using a hypothesis-test methodology to investigate the socioeconomic causes of the spatial changes of the five ecosystem services. On the basis of the modeling results of nitrogen retention and water yield, this chapter exemplifies the distinctions between ecosystem services potential, flow and demand and performs a sensitivity analysis to test the influences of input data and parameter uncertainties on the modeling results. The hypothesis-test analysis reveals only a small number of socioeconomic influential factors, most of which are related to land use structure. The hypothesis-test methodology provided in this study is applicable in the investigation of socioeconomic influences on ecosystem services in the situation of socioeconomic data uncertainty and scarcity. \nChapter 5 summarizes the sources of uncertainties in landscape analysis and ecosystem service assessments and proposes a methodology to analyze and reduce the uncertainties. The fundamental uncertainty origins of landscape analysis are landscape complexity and methodological uncertainties. The major uncertainty sources of ecosystem service assessments include the complexity of the natural system, respondents’ preferences and technical problems. Among these uncertainty source categories, initial data uncertainty pervades the whole assessment process and the limited knowledge about the complexity of ecosystems is the focal uncertainty origin. To analyze the uncertainties in assessments, systems analysis, scenario simulation and the comparison method are promising strategies. Lastly, we assume that the actions to reduce uncertainties should integrate continuous learning, expanding respondent numbers and sources, considering representativeness, improving and standardizing assessment methods and optimizing spatial and geobiophysical data. \nChapter 6 reaches the general conclusions of this thesis. It firstly answers the four research questions asked in the introduction. In the answers, the close connections between ecosystem services and socioeconomics are confirmed, the applicability of the mainstreaming quantification methods is debated, the strength of ecosystem service mapping is illustrated and the necessity and possibility of uncertainty analysis are argued. In ending the entire thesis, chapter 6 further generally evaluates the ecosystem service approach and identifies and main obstacles and problems in the application of ecosystem services. Moreover, it proposes potential solutions to the overcome the impediments and finally calls for an optimistic attitude to propel ecosystem services research.","Welcome to the third installment of American Anthropologist’s new “Public Anthropology Reviews” section. We hope the section is fast becoming an important resource and space to present, constructively critique, and debate cutting-edge anthropological work that seeks to reach nonacademic audiences and influence critical issues of the day. If you missed the section’s first two issues, we encourage you to revisit those reviews (available in the journal and open access at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/ 123301409/PDFSTART) and our introduction to the section (Checker et al. 2009). In this issue, we begin with our first “dialogic review,” which will generally feature an anthropologist and an interlocutor offering two perspectives on the impact and import of a work of public anthropology. In this case, we feature Vibrant, the six-year-old biannual international journal of the Association of Brazilian Anthropologists (ABA), which is seeking to increase the global accessibility of Brazilian anthropology by publishing in English, French, and Spanish— rather than just in Portuguese—and by making Vibrant available free online. Gustavo Lins Ribeiro, who oversaw the launch of Vibrant as president of the ABA and remains an editorial board member, offers an overview of the linguistic, technological, and political-economic complexities of expanding the diversity of anthropological voices and disseminating anthropological knowledge around the globe. Then interlocutor Janet Chernela critiques the journal from the point of view of a reader. Eric C. Thompson discusses another effort to introduce anthropological perspectives into popular discourse in his review of “Ini Budaya Kita” (lit., this Is Our Culture), Julian Lee’s regular column for a Malaysian art and lifestyle magazine. As Thompson explains, Lee and a number of anthropologically inclined guest writers bring anthropological insights to contemporary Malaysian life while questioning popular, and generally narrow, understandings of “culture” that are frequently used by political conservatives “to rail against all manner of things—from music to political protest—by disparagingly commenting. . . . this is not our culture” (this issue). Next, Robert Rotenberg discusses Jared Braiterman’s Tokyo Green Space blog on “microgardening.” The blog is documenting efforts to use gardening in the smallest and most unusual urban spaces—rooftops, walls, schools—“to support biodiversity in the world’s largest city” (this issue). Of particular interest to environmental and urban anthropologists, not to mention gardeners, Rotenberg’s review describes a blog that combines design anthropology, lush color photography, and the eye and imagination of the flâneur to explore a transforming Tokyo. Finally, Edward M. Maclin brings us an analysis of anthropologists’ presence at the 2009 global climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark. Drawing on his own, at times harrowing, research at the talks, Maclin describes some of the challenges faced by anthropologists studying climate change and environmental activism in both conducting research and disseminating research findings about an issue of such obvious global significance beyond academia. In future issues, we intend to review a broad range of topics including the U.S. military’s Human Terrain program, anthropologists’ response to the earthquake in Haiti, service learning, new publishing experiments, and changes to tenure requirements. We continue to welcome submissions for work to be reviewed as well as the names of potential reviewers (e-mail publicanthreviews@gmail.com). We also welcome your suggestions, critique, and other feedback as we develop this important new section of American Anthropologist.","Earth’s surface is changing rapidly due to anthropogenic disturbance and thus threatening the conservation of entire biomes: from deserts to tropical rainforests and from oceans to mountains. Within this spectrum, forests are one of the biomes which has suffered the most due to the exploitation of natural resources and the expansion of the urban environment into natural landscapes. Specially the case of temperate forests which offer favourable conditions for a variety of economic activities, such as: food and timber production but as well for a blooming human life. The high concentration of humans in temperate forests has led to high indices of land conversion and fragmentation, threatening the conservation of the unique biodiversity harboured in these forests. For example, the loss of apex predators has led to the overabundance of wild ungulates in most of the temperate forests, increasing the top-down control that these animals have over vegetation. The top-down control of wild ungulates can influence several forest attributes such as forest diversity, structure and functioning. However, these effects are highly dependent on ungulate density, successional forest stage and the ungulate assemblage composition. Yet, there is a limited amount of field and experimental studies that elaborate on these important factors, mainly because there is a lack of long-term exclosures and a lack of studies that have evaluated the effect of a complete ungulate density gradient on forests in the same region. This thesis aims to evaluate the effects of wild ungulates on temperate forests at different scales. That is, how do wild ungulates affect forests at different 1) spatial scales (from areas with low to areas with high ungulate abundance)?, 2) temporal scales (from short-term to long-term effects)?, and 3) hierarchical scales (from trophic levels of primary producers to detritivores)? To tackle these questions, robust methods were designed in this thesis, such as a chronosequence of forest succession in presence and absence of ungulates, camera-traps paired to vegetation plots across a landscape, a global literature review on the effects of ungulate density on vegetation and litter bags placed inside and outside ungulate exclosures. Next, a description is provided for each of the chapters on their research and findings. To evaluate how ungulates affect different temperate forest attributes, a global quantitative literature review was conducted in chapter two. This meta-analysis provided a better understanding on how ungulate density interacts with forests at a global scale and identifies critical thresholds in ungulate density and tipping points in forests when the effect of ungulate density switches from neutral to negative in forests. From a total of 164 studies, ungulate density averaged 23.6 km-2 across studies. Ungulate density had negative effects on forest regeneration, structure and functioning in 70% of the evaluated cases. The dose-response curves had a sigmoidal shape. Critical tipping points, where ungulates started to have a negative effect on forest regeneration, were found at an ungulate metabolic weight density of 115 kg km-2 for forest regeneration, 141 kg km-2 for forest structure, and 251 kg km-2 for forest functioning, which is roughly equivalent to 10, 13 and 23 roe deer km-2. Forest regeneration was most sensitive to immediate browsing and trampling impacts of small seedlings, while forest functioning was least sensitive because of time lags. Yet, these effects may build-up over time. Chapter three on the short-term evaluated the shape of the dose-response for ten sites across at the Veluwe, the Netherlands, using approx. 210 camera points paired with vegetation plots. Five of the eleven forest variables measured were related to deer utilization level. With increasing red deer utilization, there was a decrease in litter depth. With increasing fallow deer utilization, there was a decrease in sapling richness. With increasing roe deer utilization, there was a decrease in sapling richness and diversity and shrub cover and an increase of sapling stem density. The dose-response curve between deer utilization and different forest attributes followed a curvilinear response, large changes at low followed by small changes at high utilization level, yet the exact shape of the curve can vary according to (a)biotic factors from each study location. Considering that the slopes of the responses were quite slight, it is possible to conclude that the influence that deer have on temperate forest structure and diversity is limited. Yet, these relationships may be different in a long-term study. To provide a better understanding of how forest succession proceeds in a situation of chronic browsing and trampling, chapter four evaluated the long-term effect of ungulates on temperate forests. A chronosequence approach was used, in which 17 paired fenced and unfenced plots were compared, ranging in age from 1 to 33 years since their establishment at the Veluwe. In fenced plots, where ungulates were excluded, there was a reduced understory vegetation cover and an increased canopy cover, tree species richness, tree Shannon diversity and litter layer compared to unfenced plots. In fenced compared to unfenced plots, woody vegetation developed with palatable broadleaved species such as Betula pendula, Betula pubescens, Prunus serotina, and Quercus robur. These results suggest that current ungulate densities in this system have pronounced long-term effects on forest structure, composition and litter depth, implying that ungulates can slow down natural succession of temperate forests, from light demanding to shade tolerant tree species. Yet, it remains unclear whether these long-term effects on vegetation trigger cascading effects on lower trophic levels. In chapter five, the potential cascading effects promoted by ungulates on temperate forests were evaluated. Using a network of twelve paired fenced and unfenced plots established across the Veluwe, soil quality, litter depth, forest regeneration, soil macro-invertebrates and decomposition rates were evaluated. Plots with ungulates had significantly higher soil compaction, but lower litter depth, tree diversity and density, rodent activity, invertebrate biomass and litter decomposition rate compared to plots with ungulates. Furthermore, ungulates presence: decreased sapling density which indirectly decreased rodent activity; decreased litter depth which indirectly reduced macro-invertebrate diversity and mineralization rates of magnesium and nitrogen in pine and oak litter, and increased soil compaction which decreased invertebrate diversity and mineralization rates of magnesium and nitrogen in pine and oak litter. If the system continues in the same direction, in the future, it will no longer sustain a diverse plant community due to nutrient limitation in soil. In chapter six, the main outcomes of each of the chapters were discussed and contextualized in a broader perspective of temperate forest ecology and plant-animal interactions. Although the literature review (Ch. 2) and the long-term effect chapter (Ch. 4) reported a strong top-down relationship between ungulates and different forest attributes, the short-term effect chapter (Ch. 3) and the cascading effect chapter (Ch. 5) only reported slight relationships. These results illustrate that current ungulate densities have a gradual shaping effect on forest composition, structure and functioning of these Dutch temperate forests; although, ungulates have a smaller effect on forest functioning than (a)biotic factors like soil pH, light availability and forest type (Ch. 3 and 4). Coming back to the main research question, ungulates are important disturbance agents that create, maintain or arrest forest dynamics. According to this thesis, ungulates mostly maintain forests properties, although they also arrest forest succession and in few cases, create opportunities for the establishment of new species. Spatially, forest dose-response to ungulate abundance is curvilinear, with large changes at low and small changes at high abundance. Temporally, ungulates have steeper relationships with forest vegetation at long-term scale compared to short-term because effects on vegetation accumulate in time. Hierarchically, ungulates cascade-down their effects to other trophic levels and ecosystem processes. Ungulate relationships with forests are difficult to understand due to the system’s complexity; yet, when their interactions occur at the extreme of the scales, their effects on forests can be irreversible.","Issues related to food, water and energy are the three most team of editors, International Advisory Board, and editorial important challenges in the 21st century, due to exponential population growth, rapid urban development and climate change. There is a nexus between food, water and energy, and they are intrinsically linked and are affected by the change in climate. Currently there is a strong scientific consensus that the Earth is warming and that this warming is mainly due to human activities. Climate change will affect human societies and the natural environment resulting in economic, social and environmental consequences. Better management of water resources will ensure that quality water is available for people, industry, agriculture, livestock, and biodiversity despite climate change. Journal of Water and Climate Change is unique in being dedicated to addressing these issues, and publishing innovative research papers which are useful for both researchers and practitioners. Within this context, the scope of the journal covers all aspects of water science, technology, management and innovation in response to climate change, with emphasis on reduction of energy usage. Papers in the journal are related to the analysis of impacts, mitigation and adaptation due to climate change on water resources, as are regional studies which clearly demonstrate the use of innovative methods and techniques which bring new knowledge to those regions. The journal started in 2010 with a broad focus on water resources, water technology and engineering, and regulatory and managerial issues related to water and climate change. From humble beginnings with five editors and about 20 papers published in 2010, the journal now has grown to publish in excess of 50 papers a year in four issues. The impact factor of the journal is on an upward trajectory and is currently 1.254. We are making every effort to continually improve the quality of the journal working with our authors, reviewers,","While universities are mandated to teach, research and do community outreach, studies reveal that typical university communities live in relative isolation where research is more basic than applied. This study focused on; 1) determining how WWE could be fostered through linkages between universities and external agencies (communities, public and private sectors); 2) establishing how universities’ resources could be optimized to promote research and capacity building for WWE. The dimensions of WWE studied were; 1) Technical &amp; Business Models; 2) Capacity building; and 3) institutional frameworks. Baseline studies were conducted in which qualitative and quantitative data was collected through questionnaires, interviews, documents analysis. Experimentations were carried out whereby Laboratory tests on Bio-methane Potential (BMP) for different biomass types was conducted. A complete chain of briquettes production and consumption has been successfully piloted at St Kizito High School in Namugongo, near Kampala. The 20,000 kg of briquettes produced (from municipal bio-waste) by students monthly are used to cook in three schools whose total population is 2000 students. With an average net profit of $ 3000, the project makes business sense even in absence of social-benefit accounting. Based on start-up capital of $ 12,250, the payback period on investment is 14.7 months. Bio-char (from carbonized waste) and briquette-ash are used as organic fertilizers and biocide in vegetable gardens at the schools. New pathways for municipal waste management based on stakeholder engagement and entrepreneurship are demonstrated; departing from the conventional waste collection and disposal models. This circular enterprise which enhances Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-use and Energy (FABLE) nexus will scale-up to incorporate non-student communities (youths/women), private waste-collectors and entrepreneurs. The application of entrepreneurial models for engaging students in green enterprises integrates technological, social, economic and governance dimensions for promoting municipal sanitation, environment; energy and food security. Entrepreneurship for Youth Employment in Uganda University Education and Waste-to-Wealth Universities, Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development in Africa – Conference Proceedings 2018 doi: 10.18418/978-3-96043-071-1_146 147 Introduction Waste-to-wealth Enterprises (WWE) refers to the processes of upscaling and commercializing waste recycling. This study focuses on recycling the organic tracks of waste for production of briquettes, organic fertilizers and biocides. Conceptually, bio-waste recycling has socio-economic and environmental benefits such as: a) creating income generating opportunities for the youths and reducing unemployment; b) substitution of firewood/charcoal with bioenergy; c) promotion of organic farming; d) improvement of municipal sanitation. In light of the above, bio-waste recycling harnesses the Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-use and Energy (FABLE) nexus. The growing population in Uganda generates increased demand for food, water, energy, space (accommodation) and jobs. Attempts to satisfy the demands generate multiple vulnerabilities arising from; 1) reclamation of wetlands and forests for farming and accommodation; 2) depletion of soil nutrients and use of chemical fertilizers, biocides and disinfectants; 3) energy poverty leading dependency on charcoal and firewood for cooking/heating by 90% of the population; 4) Poor sanitation in high-density urban settlements; 5) pollution (of land, wáter and air); 6) unemployment and Poverty. The public sector agencies (local government, central government, ministries) are constrained financially to deliver core services to needy communities. Specifically, less than 10% of households are centrally connected to sewer lines and approximately 40% of municipal budgets are used to collect only 30% of solid waste. The remaining solid and liquid waste pollute wetlands and natural water bodies. Between 1997 and 2000, European Union banned fish imports from East Africa on grounds of water pollution. The polluters could be recycled for fuel and fertilizers. However, development of large-scale recycling schemes is still at an embryonic stage (Parawira, 2009). This is because recycling is done informally by groups that choose to pick plastics and metal scraps which they sell to recycling factories. The commercial value of bio-waste is not yet understood widely. Engaging stakeholders in resource recovery across the food, energy and water and eco-system nexus is therefore critical to address the natural resource loops. The products from recycling include; bio-fuels (biogas, briquettes), organic fertilizers, biocides and disinfectants; and animal feeds/nutrients. A market study indicates that a complete sanitation system for 400,000 urban slums in Kampala can be run without subsidies by selling fertilizer and soil improvement products (Karsten, 2011). The market potential, however, depends on local factors including existing markets, local industry requirements, supportive policies, subsidies and locally available materials. Conceptual and Theoretical framework Whereas domestic, agricultural and industrial waste is rich in nutrients and energy; and while recycling technologies exists, waste recycling is still at a small scale. Baseline surveys revealed that upscaling recycling is hampered by; a) poor quality plants and poor material choice and inexperienced contractors; b) heavy dependence of projects on donor subsidies; failing to survive beyond pilot phases; c) absence of entrepreneurial models to attract private capital; ignorance about business prospects of recycling; d) Inadequate managerial and entrepreneurial skills; e) nonstreamlined policies on recycling; f) cultural and socio-psycho sensitivities on consuming some products of recycling; g) absence of inter-sector linkages and partnerships on waste recycling; h) lack of start-up and scale-up capital for potential entrepreneurs. New pathways based on entrepreneurship and partnerships are needed to attract private capital towards bio-waste recycling. Recycling as an innovative model of waste management can only be promoted when environmental, social and economic incentives are demonstrated; and capacity built for stakeholders’ active","Abstract The aim of the studies was to compare the composition of soil bacterial metabiomes originating from urbanized areas and areas contaminated with hydrocarbons with those from agricultural soil and forest soil obtained from a protected wild-life park area. It should be noted that hydrocarbons are everywhere therefore bacteria capable of their utilization are present in every soil type. In the hydrocarbon- contaminated soil and in the soil of anthropogenic origin, the bacteria belonging to Gammaproteobacteria were dominant (28.4–36.6%), whereas in the case of agricultural soil and protected wild-life park soil their ratios decreased (22.8–23.0%) and were similar to that of Alphaproteobacteria. No statistically significant changes were observed in terms of the Operational Taxonomic Unit identified in the studies soils, however, based on the determined alpha-diversity it can be established that contaminated soils were characterized by lower biodiversity indices compared to agricultural and forest soils. Furthermore, the dioxygenase level was also evaluated in the studied soils, which are genes encoding crucial enzymes for the decomposition of mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during the biodegradation of diesel oil (PAHRHDαGN, PAHRHDαGP, xylE, Cat 2,3, ndoB). It was concluded that both the population structure of the soil metabiome and the number of genes crucial for biodegradation processes differed significantly between the soils. The level of analysed genes showed a similar trend, as their highest number in relations to genes encoding 16S RNA was determined in urban and hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.","The purpose of the present work was Mercury determination in river Ravi, different nalas from Lahore, Head Balloki water and their sediments located in Punjab Pakistan in the summer and winter seasons. Tekran-2500 cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer employed for determination of Hg in water samples and Zeeman mercury analyzer for sediments. The results show highest Hg concentration in Hudiara drain at all three sampling areas in the summer season. Mehmood Booti nala showed high concentration at terminal point before entering into river water with 84.6±28.11 ng/l concentration. Water at Head Balloki showed 67.3±14.51ng/L concentration in the side running water. The river water sampling before the studied point also showed 1.2±0.4 ng/l concentration. Bhek Nala and Farrukhabad Nala showed relatively less concentration of mercury compared to other nalas. The mercury level was found highest in the sediments of Hudiara drain in both seasons. The high concentration in water tends to accumulates in the different organs of the aquatic organisms. in the current study of Tilapia and Labeo rohita shows the order of the concentration from higher to lower was kidney, liver, gills and muscle where in case of tilapia the accumulation order in slightly different starting from gills, kidney, liver and muscle respectively. The level of CAT was decreased in response high concnetration. Mercury treatment stimulated the liver and gill tissue to significantly increase the level of SOD which might be due to synthesis of SOD and addition in the pre-existing SOD level. The MDA level of gills and liver tissue was increased with the increase in the concentration. *Corresponding Author: Muhammad Saleem Khan  samiikhan@yahoo.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 8, No. 4, p. 63-72, 2016 http://www.innspub.net J.

Introduction Heavy metals are among the most common environmental pollutants, and their occurrence in water and biota indicate the presence of natural sources, associated with chemical weathering of minerals and soil leaching, or anthropogenic sources that are mainly concerned with industrial and domestic effluents, urban storm, water runoff, landfill, mining of coal and ore, atmospheric sources and inputs rural areas. Water pollution by trace metals is an important factor in both geochemical cycling of metals and in environmental health. The existence of heavy metals in aquatic environments has led to serious concerns about their influence on plant and animal life (Luoma et al., 2008; Förstner and Wittmann, 2012; Ghaleno et al., 2015). Rivers are one of the important fresh water reservoirs and are threatened with the pollution resulting from urban and industrial waste water which is disposed off into rivers without any treatment (Yasar et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2015; Nzeve et al., 2015). Pakistan is blessed with rivers and all of them flow through Punjab province Pakistan. River Ravi arises in Bara Bangal, a branch of the Dhauladhar range of Himalayas in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, a state of India and finally enters into Punjab Province of Pakistan after cutting Dhauladhar (Förstner and Wittmann, 2012). Intense pollution contributed by both India and Pakistan is threatening irrigation and ground waters and also terrestrial and aquatic life in River Ravi. About 1307.08 tons of hazardous and untreated waste is going into Ravi on daily basis. The load from district Lahore is 728.75 tons per day. Food chain contamination by heavy metals has become a burning issue in recent years because of their potential accumulation in bio stems through contaminated water, soil and air. Therefore, the study of river ecotoxicity has gained immense importance because of multiple use of river water for human consumption, agriculture and industry (Javed and Hayat, 1999; Rood River, 2012; Damodharan, 2013; Khan et al.,2016). Mercury is among the most toxic elements present in industrial and urban waste water. The major sources of mercury in the environment are increasing due to discharge from hydroelectric, mining, pulp, dental preparation, and paper and cement industries (Luoma et al., 2008; Förstner and Wittmann, 2012). Although most mercury compounds and uses are now banned or about to be banned, however, mercury is still used in thermometers and dental amalgams. Also, mercury can still be found as an additive in old paints for water proofing and marine antifouling (mercuric arsenate), in old pesticides (mercuric chloride in fungicides, insecticides), in wood preservatives (mercuric chloride), cosmetic products, in embalming fluids (mercuric chloride), in germicidal soaps and antibacterial products (mercuric chloride and mercuric cyanide), as mercury-silver-tin alloys and for \"silver mirrors\" (Clifton, 2007). The estimated emissions of mercury worldwide are reported to be about 2,200 metric tons per annum. Interestingly, one-third of this quantity arises from natural sources and two-third from human activities such as fossil fuels burning and medical wastes. Mercury may exist as inorganic mercury in the form of HgO, Hg+2, or as organic mercury in the form of methyl mercury (MeHg), ethylmercury, and dimethylmercury. All forms of mercury pose risk of toxicity to humans. Analytical speciation is therefore essential to determine the various forms of Hg in order to predict their effects on biological systems including human beings (Boszke et al., 2002; Baeyens et al., 2007; Houston, 2011; Karagas et al., 2012). The accurate determination of Hg and other elements in environmental, biological or medical samples is a very challenging task. Extremely low levels of this metal combined with numerous interferences in the most sensitive analytical techniques are considered to be the major difficulties. The most appropriate techniques for the determination of Hg include inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPJ. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 65 | Hamid et al. MS), especially in combination with isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and electro-thermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). However, all of the mentioned techniques suffer from severe limitations which restrict their application to selected samples only in particular some methods work only for a specific type of sample and are inadequate for the analysis of other sample types. For example ICP-OES and ET-AAS can be applied, but imply prior pre-concentration and/or matrix-separation steps to assess Hg and As concentrations at the required trace levels. ICP-MS suffers from matrix induced non-spectral interferences, as well as spectral interferences caused by monoatomic or polyatomic ions produced in the plasma from matrix components (Mandal &amp; Suzuki, 2002; Mukhtar &amp; Limbeck, 2010; Sanchez-Rodas et al., 2010; Azizullah et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2013). The AFS could be of great interest for the determination of Hg in water samples without requiring the use of expensive ultrasensitive multi elemental instrumentation, like ICP-MS (Ammann, 2011). A lot of work has done on the toxicity of heavy metals in aquatic environment nationally and internationally. The heavy metals enter into the aquatic organisms through gills and food web and accumulated in the different organs. After accumulation the metals causes toxicity to oxidative stress leading to the genotoxicity (Khan et al., 2015a; Khan et al., 2015b). In an experiment on Oreochromis mossambicus in Indus River in Mianwali (Pakistan) studies revealed pathological changes in liver and gill tissues, this shows these biomarkers can be employed to evaluate the toxicity of heavy metals in aquatic life (Jabeen and Chaudhry, 2013). In current study, the Hg concentrations has been determined in River Ravi and various sewage and industrial effluents falling into the river, metal bioaccumulation and its effects on antioxidant enzymes was studied. Materials and methods The different waste water falls into River Ravi named Mahmood Booti, Bhek Nala, Farrukh Abad drain, Bakar Mandi Nala and Hudiara drain were selected as sampling points at three locality 1, 2 and 3 for start of nala, at the start of mixing nala waste with river water and at terminal of nala before it drops its wastes in the river respectively where in river water and samples were sampled at three localities including locality-1 middle of river, locality-2 side of river running water and locality-3 standing waters before the entrance of these nalas in the River. Similar sampling was done at head Balloki region. The sampling of water and sediments was done during time period of August, and January, at above mentioned points. The two seasons (summer and winter) were representative of seasonal variation of heavy metal pollution of River Ravi. Additionally, sampling of fresh Ravi water and sediments was also done before the beginning of waste water tributaries in order to check the quality of non-contaminated water. The sampling of water and sediments was done in pre-cleaned 50 ml polypropylene tubes. For cleaning the tubes were soaked well before use in 2% (v/v) HNO3 solution for 24 hours followed by drying in an oven at 70 0C till dryness. The tubes were filled with surface water from river and above mentioned points and preserved by adding HNO3 (1% v/v). Similarly, sediments of river and waste drains were collected at the same points where from water samples were collected. All precautionary measurements were taken during sampling in order to avoid contamination of water and sediment samples from external sources. The samples were transported to lab after sampling. For measurement of as in water samples, about 2 ml Conc. HNO3 was added to 20 ml of water samples taken into Teflon digestion cups followed by heating at 90°C for 1 hour with cover in order to avoid sample losses. This led to the digestion of organ","One of the Sustainable Development Goals promoted by the UN, as well as in other international declarations and strategic documents (WHO, European Union), is to ensure: “universal access to safe, public green spaces”. The main goal of this article is to present and discuss selected indicators of accessibility and attractiveness of urban green spaces (especially those formal and publicly available). The review includes both indicators constructed for research purposes and for spatial planning in cities. Many indicators have been proposed in the literature to measure access to green spaces, taking into account aspects such as: distance, green space area and amount of green space per capita. Such indicators are very general, they do not reflect the condition of a particular green space, and they are used mostly for planning purposes. Sometimes, they are extended to issues closely related to access, such as property rights, opening hours and physical barriers (e.g. busy roads or rivers that significantly hinder access to a given green space). Moreover, these indicators are connected with additional features of green spaces pertaining to their attractiveness (cleanliness, equipment, number of users, biodiversity). Only such a comprehensive analysis of accessibility and attractiveness allows us to capture the actual state of affairs and the possible implementation of activities improving access to attractive urban green spaces. These indicators capture respectively the accessibility of green spaces and their attractiveness. The review mainly covered English-language literature. The article provides a review of existing indicators and synthesizes knowledge related to the broadly understood access and attractiveness of urban green spaces.","Urbanization problems and sustainable development has become global issues and got a lot of attention from stakeholders in various countries. Indonesia as developing country faces their significant problem in urban management complexity. The city government take the real impact of development problems that increasingly difficult to control. Batu city is the youngest autonomous city in East Java province, Indonesia, located in the upper Brantas river and has steep slope topography. Since its establishment, Batu City has experienced the rapid economic and population growth whict allegedly also cause the increase of environmental degradation. \nThe purpose of this research is to analyze the sustainability index value of ecological, economic, socio-cultural, infrastructure and institutional dimensision in assessing the development sustainability status of Batu city using Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, analyzing the sensitive attributes of sustainability dimensions using leverage analysis and develop the strategies in sustainable urban development using SWOT analysis. The results showed that the development sustainability status of Batu city, the ecological dimension in the category of less sustainable (46.90 %), the economic dimension is sustainable enough (56.52 %), the social dimensionis sustainable enuogh (60.40 %), the infrastructure dimension is sustainable enough (63.31 %), and the institutional dimensions in sustainable enough (72.68 %). Attributes that affect the sustainability status assessment in terms of the ecological dimension are water quality, air quality and biodiversity; in the review of the economic dimension are investment growth, price stability and tourism visitation; while from socio-cultural dimension are porverty, health and security; in terms of the dimensions of infrastructure are public sanitation , affordable hause and clean water pipeline; and the institutional dimension are development planning, information systems and local apparatus.","The aim of this paper is to investigate how and to what extent the provision of major open spaces has been integrated (or not) into the metropolitan planning process in Sydney over the last 60 years. There is a focus on three specific dimensions of this history: roles and influence of various agencies responsible for the implementation of open space; shifting values and concepts which influenced delivery of open space; and comparison of proposals for significant regional greenspaces against the parks and open spaces that eventuated. The analysis is based primarily on a review of statutory metropolitan planning strategies and annual reports of state planning departments and authorities. It is framed across three distinct periods of urban planning in Sydney: 1940s—1960s (a period framed by two robust strategic plans when the foundation of a metropolitan green web was activated); 1960s—1980s (implementation of 1968 strategic corridor thinking through to emergence of sustainability concerns in policy-making), and 1990s to the present (from early concerns for climate change through to the multivalent notion of green infrastructure). Introduction Contemporary concerns for sustainable urban form and the related issues of human and ecological health have renewed advocacy for the adequate and equitable provision of metropolitan open space. These concerns are supported by evidence from ecologists and social scientists demonstrating that connectivity of urban form, particularly open space, provides multiple benefits, including improved biodiversity, community cohesion, and physical health of humans, and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Large-scale regional open space has long been valued as a quality-of-life resource for metropolitan residents, but different rationales have underpinned its advocacy and progress toward implementation has stuttered between missed opportunities and spectacular successes shaped and constrained by diverse cultural and Metropolitan Open Space in Sydney 3 institutional frameworks. Sydney, for example, was bequeathed major reserves and national parks in the 19 century and thereafter has made faltering advances toward even a notional open space network. This empirical paper is broadly concerned with how provision of major open spaces has been integrated (or not) into the metropolitan planning process in Sydney over the last 60 years. There is a focus on three specific dimensions of this history: Roles and influence of various agencies responsible for the implementation of open space; Shifting values and concepts which influenced the delivery of open space; • Comparison of proposals for significant regional greenspaces against the parks and open spaces that eventuated. The analysis is framed across several distinct periods of urban planning in Sydney: 1940s— 1960s (a period framed by two robust strategic plans when the foundation of a metropolitan green web was activated); 1960s—1980s (implementation of 1968 strategic corridor thinking through to emergence of sustainability concerns in policy-making), and 1990s to the present (from early concerns for climate change through to the multivalent notion of green infrastructure). The significance of decisions taken in the late 1940s and late 1960s for comprehending open space planning in Sydney becomes evident. 1940s-1960s: The County of Cumberland Council Metropolitan Open Space in Sydney 4 The County of Cumberland Council (CCC) was established in 1945 with the aim of preparing the first strategic land-use plan for the Sydney metropolitan region. Both the Council and the plan it produced were innovative; the planning scheme was the first statutory regional land-use plan for Sydney while the Council, comprising representatives of local government electorates, was a new type of authority, situated intermediate between local councils and state government. Its coordinative aspirations at times set the council against state level departments, whilst at times its regional outlook could be difficult to reconcile with the interests of its ultimate constituents. (Neutze,1978). Nonetheless, the CCC proposals for open space were a response to contemporary global and regional, rather than local, concerns. These included a rapidly growing population, a spreading suburban footprint, increased leisure time and access to automobiles, Sydney’s rising role as a destination for national and international tourists, and the knowledge and acceptance of the link between physical recreation and human health (Cumberland County Council, 1948, p.139; Winston, 1957, p. 45). The Planning Scheme for the County of Cumberland (PSCC), prepared by the Council in 1948 and approved in 1951, articulated three aims which reflected its regional outlook (Winston 1957, p. 39): • coordination of land use; • consolidation of development; • conservation of natural and historical assets. Metropolitan Open Space in Sydney 5 Open space was concieved as playing a critical role in achieving these aim and shaping the urban region. Its multiple roles included tempering the pressure of subdivisions, insulating disparate land uses, protecting scenic areas, articulating suburban sub-regions and providing recreational areas. The CCC typology of open space was broad and varied: open space included scenic and recreation parcels, productive land such as forestry reserves, agricultural areas, and institutional campuses, as well as land that separated built-up zones from each other. The five types of open spaces proposed a county green belt, district open spaces, national parks and other major reserves (including foreshore scenic reserves), and rural areas reflect this conceptual breadth, but even more importantly, initiated a comprehensive open space agenda across the Sydney metropolitan region. The green belt The green belt and district open spaces were novel elements for Sydney. The green belt was a central feature of the Planning Scheme, partly due to its projected size—128 square miles (332 km, but also because of its primary role of containing urban sprawl. The CCC described it as ‘a girdle of rural open space encircling the urban districts and penetrating towards the centre between some of the outer districts, ensuring for all time ready access by urban populations to a countryside specially planned and maintained for their benefit’(Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 65). In reality, the green belt was a strip of open country on the outer fringe of the existing built-up area linking Ku-ring-gai Chase in the north to the (Royal) National Park in the south. Consisting primarily of grassland and scrubby woodland, its width and character varied with the terrain, with the more extensive tracts in open, undulating country with limited agricultural or scenic value (Freestone, 1992; County of Cumberland Council 1948, p.216). Metropolitan Open Space in Sydney 6 Mostly in private ownership, it represented a little under 10% of the metropolitan (County of Cumberland) area. The green belt was to be the antidote for ‘promiscuous urbanisation’ (Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 129). It was conceived as a permanent barrier to suburban sprawl; that is, a check on the proliferation of premature, low density subdivisions. It would define the physical extent of the metropolis for the relatively modest target population in the PSCC, and was in effect an inner rural zone which would conserve rural land in production and preserve scenic landscapes. The primary basis of planning control in the green belt was a general prohibition against building on sites less than 2 hectares, considered the smallest area from which a livelihood could be obtained from full agricultural development (Freestone, 1992). Many people, particularly developers and small landholders, interpreted the green belt as a government imposed restriction on development rights, and associated economic gains; as a result the green belt became highly contested. In addition, because the belt was adjacent to dynamic urban areas, it was highly vulnerable to growth pressures, and was steadily encroached upon. By 1957 16 km was released for urban expansion; in 1959 the Minister for Local Government released a further 119 km, in effect abandoning the concept (Freestone, 1992). The green web The district open space system or the green web, proposed by the PSCC, was a network of open space within the area bounded by the green belt. The web was given the task of ‘preserving the identity of the urban districts, providing the means for physical recreation of district populations Metropolitan Open Space in Sydney 7 and preserving much of the County’s best natural scenery’ (Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 65). Comprising 22,000 acres (9 ha), it wove together patches of the existing open spaces lining Sydney’s dendritic river and waterway systems such as Middle Harbour, Lane Cove River, Wolli Creek, Cook’s River, Prospect Creek, Long Cove Creek, Duck River-Haslam’s Creek, and Iron Cove Creek. Unlike the green belt, this proposal responded clearly to landscape conditions, particularly topography, being largely comprised of land considered undevelopable. It also developed at a larger scale the incipient system described in the PSCC as the ‘singular great belt of open space’ extending from Bennelong Point on Port Jackson to Centennial and Moore Parks, and through to Botany Bay (Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 137). The green web proposal was also underpinned in principle by the normative standard of provision of 10 acres of open space per 1,000 people and a baseline size of 15 ha as an indicator of county significance (Cunneen, 1980, p. 114; Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 136). A 1951 survey of open space based on these standards confirmed inadequate provision across the metropolitan area, poor distribution of types, and inappropriate siting of uses (Cunneen, 1980; Cumberland County Council, 1948, p. 136). The CCC marshalled this evidence to determine that the p","The Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area (GBMWHA) covers just over a million hectares, and comprises eight national parks. It is one of the most fire-prone regions on Earth, has extensive adjoining urban areas and contains internationally significant ecosystems and biodiversity. These features present significant management challenges, and increase the need for good science to underpin decision-making. We carried out a synthesis of fire regime information for the GBMWHA, calculated fire frequencies for the four decades to 2010 and determined the status of area in relation to ‘fire-biodiversity thresholds’ that are suggested for the maintenance of plant species diversity. We found current fire frequencies across the GBMWHA are broadly appropriate, with approximately 76% of the landscape within threshold. In addition, we generated fire severity maps for the GBMWHA for all five major bush fire seasons since 1990, using two different satellite image types (Landsat, SPOT) and two different approaches (pre/post-fire image differencing and single post-fire image analysis). Both image types and approaches produced useful fire severity maps, but imagedifferencing with Landsat produced the best cost-effective results. The resulting maps show the patterns of fire intensity for each of the bush fire seasons and provide new broad-scale information on this less-commonly documented component of fire regimes. The comprehensive fire history now available for the GBMWHA is one of the most detailed in Australia, and is being used for fire planning and management, as a baseline against which to assess climate change impacts, and in further research.","Marine pollution is one of the main anthropogenic factors identified globally to affect the estuarine and coastal ecosystems. One of the recipients of pollutants is the mangroves since they are intercepting between land and ocean. In recent years, the mangrove forests have been proposed for use as natural wastewater treatment wetlands. This is based on research findings conducted in countries like China. However, before promoting the use of natural mangrove as pollution buffers, the effect of these pollutants on the ecosystems‟ biodiversity must be assessed. This study aimed at determining the impact of pollution on the feeding, bioturbation and biomass of the fiddler crab Uca annulipes in Gazi and Mikindani along the Kenya Coast. The mangroves in Mikindani on Tudor creek represented peri-urban mangroves which are heavily impacted by municipal wastewater, while the mangroves in Gazi Bay in the South Coast of Kenya represented mangroves not affected by direct sewage input. In addition, crabs Uca annulipes are one of the most important groups of mangrove epifauna. To investigate the impacts of pollution on the feeding, bioturbation and biomass of Uca annulipes a stratified nested design was adopted. The mangroves selected for the study manifested distinctive zonation pattern in the dominance of their mangrove species, due to this, a stratified random sampling approach was applied at each site. Sampling was conducted in 2 × 2 m 2 quadrats in desert and Avicennia zones during July, August and October 2005. Data collection depended on each full moon springs and new moon springs when spring tides would be realised. Different parameters were measured, Chlorophyl a (Chl a) concentrations in the feeding pellets and nonprocessed soils, amount of bioturbated soils (expressed as dry weight of excavated material and feeding pellets), and biomass (dry weight) of Uca annulipes. Four factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were applied to determine whether there were significant difference in feeding, bioturbation and biomass of Uca annulipes within the two sites. Results show significant differences in Chl a concentration was observed in the feeding pellets in the Avicennia zone (F1, 88=0.146; p 0.05).The Avicennia zone of the peri-urban site had a higher Uca annulipes biomass compared to the nonurban Gazi (F1,16=54.48, p&lt;0.05). There was no relationship between the mass of bioturbated material and Uca biomass (R 2 =0.0197, p &lt; 0.05). Results also show that the amount of excavated material did not relate to the Uca biomass (R 2 = 0.0248, p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, fiddler crabs through feeding, burrowing and ventilation activities have an influence on microbial activity and sediment metabolism in marine sediments. Therefore, the feeding pattern in the peri-urban site indicated the need for further study of the actual potential of natural mangroves to absorb pollutants in sewage water since it will be important to find out what the crabs are feeding on.","Estuaries––one of the most vulnerable ecosystems globally––face anthropogenic threats, including biodiversity loss and the collapse of sustainable fisheries. Determining the factors contributing to the maintenance of estuarine biodiversity, especially that of fish, is vital for promoting estuarine conservation and sustainability. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis to determine fish species composition in 22 estuaries around Japan and measured watershed‐scale land‐use factors (e.g., population size, urban area percentage, and forest area percentage). We sought to test the hypothesis that the richness of the most vulnerable estuarine fish species (i.e., registered by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment in the national species red‐list) is determined by watershed‐scale land‐use factors. The richness of such species was greater, where forest cover was highest; thus, forest cover contributes to their conservation. The proportion of agriculture cover was associated with low species richness of red‐listed fishes (redundancy analysis, adjusted R2 = 43.9% of total variance, df = 5, F = 5.3843, p = 0.0001). The number of red‐listed species increased from 3 to 11 along a watershed land‐use gradient ranging from a high proportion of agriculture cover to a large proportion of forest cover. Furthermore, the results showed that throughout Japan all the examined watersheds that were covered by &gt;74.8% forest had more than the average (6.7 species per site) richness of red‐listed fish species. This result can be attributed to the already high average forest cover in Japan of 67.2%. Our results demonstrate how the land use of watersheds can affect the coastal sea environment and its biodiversity and suggest that proper forest management in conjunction with land‐use management may be of prime importance for threatened fish species and coastal ecosystems in general.","World’s ecosystems are under great pressure satisfying anthropogenic demands, with freshwaters being of central importance. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has identified anthropogenic land use and associated stressors as main drivers in jeopardizing stream ecosystem functions and the \nbiodiversity supported by freshwaters. Adverse effects on the biodiversity of freshwater organisms, such as macroinvertebrates, may propagate to fundamental ecosystem functions, such as organic matter breakdown (OMB) with potentially severe consequences for ecosystem services. In order to adequately protect and preserve freshwater ecosystems, investigations regarding potential and observed as well as direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic land use and associated stressors (e.g. nutrients, pesticides or heavy metals) on ecosystem functioning and stream biodiversity are needed. While greater species diversity most likely benefits ecosystem functions, the direction and magnitude of changes in ecosystem functioning depends primarily on species functional traits. In this context, the functional diversity of stream organisms has been suggested to be a more suitable predictor of changes in ecosystem functions than taxonomic diversity. \nThe thesis aims at investigating effects of anthropogenic land use on (i) three ecosystem functions by anthropogenic toxicants to identify effect thresholds (chapter 2), (ii) the organic matter breakdown by three land use categories to identify effects on the functional level (chapter 3) and (iii)on the stream community along an established land-use gradient to identify effects on the community level. \nIn chapter 2, I reviewed the literature regarding pesticide and heavy metal effects on OMB, primary production and community respiration. From each reviewed study that met inclusion criteria, the toxicant concentration resulting in a reduction of at least 20% in an ecosystem function was standardized based on laboratory toxicity data. Effect thresholds were based on the relationship between ecosystem functions and standardized concentration-effect relationships. The analysis revealed that more than one third of pesticide observations indicated reductions in ecosystem functions at concentrations that are assumed being protective in regulation. However, high variation within and between studies hampered the derivation of a concentration-effect relationship and thus effect thresholds. \nIn chapter 3, I conducted a field study to determine the microbial and invertebrate-mediated OMB by deploying fine and coarse mesh leaf bags in streams with forested, agricultural, vinicultural \nand urban riparian land use. Additionally, physicochemical, geographical and habitat parameters were monitored to explain potential differences in OMB among land use types and sites. Regarding results, only microbial OMB differed between land use types. The microbial OMB showed a negative relationship with pH while the invertebrate-mediated OMB was positively related to tree cover. OMB responded to stressor gradients rather than directly to land use. \nIn chapter 4, macroinvertebrates were sampled in concert with leaf bag deployment and after species identification (i) the taxonomic diversity in terms of Simpson diversity and total taxonomic \nrichness (TTR) and (ii) the functional diversity in terms of bio-ecological traits and Rao’s quadratic entropy was determined for each community. Additionally, a land-use gradient was established and the response of the taxonomic and functional diversity of invertebrate communities along this gradient was investigated to examine whether these two metrics of biodiversity are predictive for the rate of OMB. Neither bio-ecological traits nor the functional diversity showed a significant relationship with \nOMB. Although, TTR decreased with increasing anthropogenic stress and also the community structure and 26 % of bio-ecological traits were significantly related to the stress gradient, any of these shifts propagated to OMB. \nOur results show that the complexity of real-world situations in freshwater ecosystems impedes the effect assessment of chemicals and land use for functional endpoints, and consequently our potential to predict changes. We conclude that current safety factors used in chemical risk assessment may not be sufficient for pesticides to protect functional endpoints. Furthermore, simplifying real-world stressor gradients into few land use categories was unsuitable to predict and quantify losses in OMB. Thus, the monitoring of specific stressors may be more relevant than crude land use categories to detect effects on ecosystem functions. This may, however, limit the large scale assessment of the status of OMB. Finally, despite several functional changes in the communities the functional diversity over several trait modalities remained similar. Neither taxonomic nor functional diversity were suitable predictors of OMB. Thus, when understanding anthropogenic impacts on the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is of main interest, focusing on diversity metrics that are clearly linked to the stressor in question (Jackson et al. 2016) or integrating taxonomic and functional metrics (Mondy et al., 2012) might enhance our predictive capacity.","As the American Southwest faces its deepest drought in history, this book explores the provocative notion of “water bankruptcy” with a view towards emphasizing the diversity and complexity of water issues in this region. It bridges between the narratives of growth and the strategies or policies adopted to pursue competing agendas and circumvent the inevitable. A window of opportunity provided by this current long-term drought may be used to induce change by dealing with threats that derive from imbalances between growth patterns and available resources, the primary cause of scarcity.\n\nA first of its kind, this book was developed through close collaboration of a broad range of natural scientists, social scientists, and resource managers from Europe and United States. It constitutes a collective elaboration of a transdisciplinary approach to unveiling the inner workings of how water was fought for, allocated and used in the American Southwest, with a focus on Arizona. Specifically, it offers an innovative scientific perspective that produces a critical diagnostic evaluation of water management, with a particular view to identifying risks for the Tucson region that is facing continuous urban sprawl and economic growth.\n\nThe book offers a diversity of complementary perspectives, including a statement of natural resources, biodiversity and their management, an analysis of water policy and its history, and a statement of ecosystem services in the context of both local biodiversity and also the economic activities that sustain economic growth. Finally, it presents a concerted effort to explore the interplay between a variety of related scientific disciplines and frameworks including climatology, hydrology, water management, ecosystem services, societal metabolism, political economy and social science.","Environmental Context. Acid sulfate soils are found in many low-lying coastal areas, but they can also be encountered in inland areas of Australia and other parts of the world. These soils typically contain iron sulfides, primarily pyrite (FeS2) and mackinawite (FeS), and the products that result from oxidation of these iron minerals. Acidic and metal-rich waters can be produced when the pyrite in soil is oxidized by natural means or accelerated when the soil is drained, which typically occurs when it is developed for agriculture or urban use. In general, acid sulfate soils become a problem when oxidation products are transported from the soil profile into nearby streams and estuaries, which can severely affect the ecology, biodiversity, economic development, and the aesthetics of adjacent waterways. The key contributors to acidity in drainage waters from the site examined are Al3+, AlSO4– and, under particular circumstances, Mn2+ and Fe2+, but the principal species contributing to acidity are strongly time variant and would be expected to vary from site to site. Abstract. Catchments that contain acid sulfate soils can discharge large quantities of acid and dissolved metals into waterways. At McLeods Creek in far northern NSW, Australia, the acidity from the hydrolysis of dissolved metal species, particularly aluminium and iron, contributes to greater than 70% of the total acidity. Therefore, a poor relationship exists between both calculated and titrated acidity and pH because of the dominant influence of these hydrolyzable metal species. Determination of the so-called ‘cold acidity’ by direct titration with NaOH yields results that are difficult to replicate because of the buffering effects of suspended solids, carbon dioxide ingassing, and/or MnII and FeII oxidation in the sample as the titration end-point is approached. Samples that are pre-treated with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide produce results (of ‘hot acidity’) that can be easily replicated and are similar to calculated acidities based on elemental analysis and speciation calculations. The cold acidity values for titrations of 105 water samples from the chosen field site are often higher than hot acidity values as a result of the loss of carbonate acidity during pre-treatment of samples for hot acidity analysis.","Assessment of sewage application in south-eastern Nigeria: Part 1 – Impact on selected soil morphological and physical properties, C.L.A.

First, air and water pollution have declined substantially, though greenhouse gas emissions have not. Second, environmental policy explains a large share of these trends. Third, much regulation of air and drinking water pollution has benefits above costs, though evidence for surface water quality regulation is less clear. Fourth, while the distribution of pollution across social groups is unequal, market-based environmental policies do not systematically improve or worsen the inequality of environmental outcomes relative to command-andcontrol standards. I also discuss recent innovations in methods and data used to evaluate these hypotheses, including increasing use of environmental administrative data, statistical cost-benefit comparisons, analysis of previously understudied policies, more detailed approaches to pollution transport, micro-macro frameworks, and a focus on the distribution of environmental outcomes. One goal of describing these hypotheses is to frame a common research agenda advancing in environmental economics. 1 I gave a version of this paper as the keynote address at the summer 2021 conference of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists. I thank participants in that session for useful questions and comments. I gratefully acknowledge discussions with Mark Jacobsen, Dave Keiser, Cathy Kling, Jim Sallee, Arthur van Benthem, and Reed Walker which informed my thinking in this paper and research it discusses, and Lucy Hackett and Calvin Tolbert for excellent research assistance. In the 1960s, concern about the US environment grew rapidly. Many causes contributed, including Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, pictures of Earth taken from space, an oil spill off Santa Barbara, the discovery of probable carcinogens in urban drinking water, the first Earth Day in 1970, and a fire on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio. Underlying these causes was a fear that amidst the prosperous postwar period, environmental degradation driven by industrialization threatened to undermine US quality of life. Reflecting prevailing fears of the time, the controversial Limits to Growth report (Meadows et al. 1972) described a future where pollution would grow exponentially for a century. These events contributed to enormous support for environmental policy. The federal government in the early 1970s created the Environmental Protection Agency and passed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and many other influential environmental policies. These laws had substantial bipartisan support. For example, the Senate passed the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments without a single nay vote, and the House approved the 1972 Clean Water Act with a vote of 247-23. A half century has passed since these laws, and the growth of both economic research and political debates on these laws give reason to step back. This paper proposes four hypotheses describing what we have learned:  Hypothesis 1 (trends): Air pollution, drinking water pollution, and surface water pollution have declined substantially over previous decades, though CO2 emissions have not.  Hypothesis 2 (causes): Environmental policy explains a large share of these trends.  Hypothesis 3 (consequences): Much regulation of air and drinking water policies has benefits above costs; evidence for surface water is less clear.  Hypothesis 4 (environmental incidence): Market-based policies and command-and-control policies do not produce systematically different distributions of environmental outcomes. These are hypotheses, not theses. I discuss evidence for each. For Hypothesis 1, evidence for air, surface water, and CO2 trends is strong, while evidence for drinking water trends is less clear. For Hypothesis 2, I discuss suggestive evidence from specific settings, though comprehensive evidence is not available. For Hypothesis 3, I focus on evidence around air pollution, though I also discuss the more limited evidence on surface water pollution. For Hypothesis 4, research is emerging; this hypothesis represents a conjecture summarizing the few available studies. While I highlight what is known about specific aspects of these hypotheses, much about them is unknown. My goal in organizing the paper around these hypotheses is both to highlight open questions of importance and to explain methods and findings from individual papers. Some relationships among these hypotheses are worth noting. The first two hypotheses provide a coherent narrative. Air, surface water, and drinking water pollution produce immediate negative and local externalities which give local residents an incentive to pressure policymakers to control them. In part for this reason, stringent environmental policies have targeted these pollutants. But CO2 emissions produce gradual global negative externalities which give local residents a weaker incentive to address them. In part for these reasons, CO2 policy has been weaker, which helps explain why CO2 has not experienced similar declines as air and water pollution. The first and third hypotheses also provide an informative comparison. The first hypothesis describes large changes in pollution over time. Researchers typically assume that the marginal cost of cleaning up pollution increases with the quantity of cleanup, i.e., marginal abatement costs increase with abatement. Given the large decreases in pollution the first hypothesis describes, one might wonder at what point the marginal cost of cleaning up pollution rises enough to equal its benefits. This third hypothesis suggests that despite large and increasing pollution control, benefits of some marginal environmental improvements continue to exceed their costs for air pollution, though the situation for surface water pollution is less clear. The third and fourth hypotheses also provide a natural comparison to fundamental results in welfare economics. The First Welfare Theorem states that under certain assumptions, including the absence of externalities, a competitive equilibrium is Pareto Efficient. The Second Welfare Theorem states that any Pareto Efficient allocation can be achieved as a competitive equilibrium given certain endowments. The third hypothesis represents a natural corollary of the First Welfare Theorem—in the presence of externalities, a competitive equilibrium in the absence of policy is not optimal, but policies that internalize the externalities can increase social welfare. The fourth hypothesis relates more to the Second Welfare Theorem—changing the distribution of economic goods like the environment can produce different allocations of goods without affecting efficiency. Put another way, one can still use efficient policy tools like pollution pricing to achieve a range of distributional outcomes. One clarification of the fourth hypothesis is important. The distribution of environmental outcomes refers to the levels of pollution that different individuals experience. It provides an incomplete measure of distribution and incidence. A more complete measure would account for how different policy instruments affect the returns to capital and labor for different individuals, heterogeneous price indices for goods that different individuals consume, and potentially interactions with other taxes (Bovenberg and Goulder 1996). While the fourth hypothesis does not fully characterize social welfare, it does describe an important component of incidence that is an increasing focus of research policy. I also highlight advances in several areas that have improved the ability of research to test these hypotheses:  Administrative data on environmental goods. Administrative data are collected in order to administer a policy, but scholars are increasingly able to use these detailed data for research.  Statistical cost-benefit tests. Historically, many studies would estimate one set of elasticities and then rely heavily on external estimates from other policies, locations, or populations (sometimes called “benefits transfer”). In some more recent settings, research can compare total or marginal costs and benefits from a single setting, without relying on external estimates from other settings. Additionally, some studies estimate confidence regions for differences between benefits and costs.  Focus on important but understudied policies. Some policies have played central roles in US environmental policy over the last half century but until recently have not been a focus of research.  Richer models of pollution transport. Increasing scientific understanding of how pollution emissions in one location affect pollution concentrations in other locations and increasing use of chemical dispersion and hydrological routing models allow economic research to examine where pollution is emitted, where it affects air and water quality, and how these two relate.  Micro-macro frameworks. Some research combines detailed microdata on individual firms and households, transparent identification of key elasticities, microfounded models of firm and consumer optimization behavior, and aggregation over an entire sector or economy. These types of micro-macro frameworks can seek to examine to what extent specific individual policies account for aggregate macroeconomic changes in the environment.  Focus on the distribution of environmental outcomes. While research has long studied the distributional consequences of economic policy, a recent body of research takes as its main focus the effects of policy on the locations where pollution is emitted and affects environmental quality. This paper provides a limited review. It focuses disproportionately on research I have been involved in, focuses almost exclusively on the US, and mostly overlooks natural resources like fisheries, forests, biodiversity, groundwater, and others. I abstract from these goods since I have less direct familiarity with them, though also because many leading",": The quality of surface water in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations is being challenged by rapid economic growth, demographics and climate change leading to widespread and severe degradation of fresh water ecosystems. With many rivers still in good condition, there are opportunities to prevent pollution and begin restoration. However, severe organic pollution is already affecting around one in seven rivers across Latin America, Africa and Asia. This poses a growing risk to public and environmental health, food security and the economy. Freshwater systems in both developed and developing nations are facing growing pressure from the discharge of harmful chemicals, such as hormone disrupters. Unfortunately, municipal water treatment has become increasingly costly and developing countries in particular have problems matching expanding public water supplies and sewerage, with inadequate treatment facilities for the newer/higher wastewater flows. As a result there is a significant risk to vital activities like inland fishing, which accounts for some 60 million jobs and almost a third of fish harvested for human consumption. Yet, until now, insufficient collection and evaluation of data has made it difficult to grasp the intensity and scope of deteriorating water quality. Sound knowledge is critical to understanding the underlying causes and developing the evidence based policies to improve it, including source control, waste treatment, ecosystem management and new forms of local and global governance. By providing a snapshot of the current situation, success stories and future challenges, this review offers a baseline to measure progress, a framework for global assessment and a pathway towards sustainable solutions for river water remediation and restoration which will assist countries looking to establish their own ferrous sulfate are reported for effective algae removal. The experimental research on the treatment of cyanobacterial bloom based on chemical algicide with main ingredient of acetic acid was carried out in Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, China in 2005, and the total algae of the experimental area reduced by 82.8% after treatment (Wang et al., 2012). As bio-engineering technology for river pollution control, the bioremediation has advanced rapidly from 1990 and has now become a promising technology. There are many advantages of the bioremediation technology over aforementioned physical and chemical approaches, such as reduced cost, low environmental influence, no secondary pollution or pollutant movement, reducing pollutant concentration by the maximum extent, available for the sites where regular pollution treatment technology is difficult to be applied, and so on. Bioremediation is a way towards sustainable and economically viable approach which uses plant and microbes based interactions on the principle of biostimulation and bioaugmentation to reduce the toxicity of pollutants in the water. sequencing-based method to quantify these markers in environmental E. coli isolates further indicating that humans constituted a major source of water contamination in the Yamato river. The NGS approaches have also proved its potential in river ecosystem or biodiversity assessment to further extend the application of DNA information for routine biomonitoring applications to an unprecedented scale. Hajibabaei et al ., (2011) demonstrated the feasibility of using 454 massively parallel pyrosequencing for species-level analysis of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate taxa commonly used for biomonitoring. Experiments were designed in order to directly compare morphology-based, Sanger sequencing DNA barcoding, and next-generation environmental barcoding approaches. The results of this study showed the ability of 454 pyrosequencing of mini-barcodes to accurately identify all species with more than 1% abundance in the pooled mixture; evidence that DNA based analysis may provide a valuable approach in finding rare species in bulk environmental samples. The application of the environmental barcoding approach by comparing benthic macroinvertebrates from an urban region to those obtained from a conservation area was also demonstrated as a potential of an environmental barcoding for biomonitoring programs. The industrial or anthropogenic activities can have impact on nearby freshwater ecosystem. Hence the main aim of the study conducted by Yergeau et al ., (2011) was to evaluate the potential impacts of oil sands mining on neighboring aquatic Athabasca River and its tributaries microbial community structure. Microbial communities were sampled from sediments in the Athabasca River and its tributaries, Canada as well as in oil sands tailing ponds. Bacterial and archaeal 16SrRNA genes were ampli ﬁed a nd sequenced using NGS technology; 454 and Ion Torrent. This study revealed that river sediments in close proximity to oil sands tailings ponds were chemically and microbiologically more similar to each other and to those from the tailings ponds than to samples obtained from further away.","The article examines and summarizes the experience in using the components of the ecological security system in European cities, which ensure the solution of problems concerning sustainable development. The research used the methods of a systematic approach, analysis and synthesis, abstraction, logical generalization. The city's ecological security system is a set of economic methods and legal tools linked by the tasks of protecting the environment and creating comfortable living conditions for the population. Based on considering conditions and factors, the above methods and tools allow making decisions on supporting the ecologically safe development of the city. The experience of sustainably- developed European cities shows that their main ecological priorities at the present stage are the following: developing renewable energy; improving the energy efficiency of buildings and structures, reducing urban motor vehicle traffic in the central part of the city, using bicycles and urban electric transport; forming green spaces in order to strengthen ecosystem resilience and preserve biodiversity; rational handling of industrial and household waste. To achieve these priorities the following methods and tools are used: the development of a circular economy; introduction of resource-saving technologies and environmental innovations; formation of the ecological consciousness of the population; the broad powers of local governments in the environmental sphere, implementation of ecological programs and projects; support for environmental entrepreneurship. It was determined that to use the European experience of the ecological security system in Ukrainian cities, it is necessary to carry out preparatory work in the legal aspect (implementation of legislation and development of regulations, standard acts, provisions) as well as in the organizational and economic aspects (formation of conditions and opportunities for the implementation of decisions made in the environmental sphere). The preposition is made that the introduction of the individual components of the ecological security system used in European sustainably-developed cities should be done in Ukraine gradually, starting with eco-projects, eco-entrepreneurship, eco-cooperation and the formation of eco-spaces. The above components of the ecological security system must be aligned with goals and priorities of the sustainable development of the city in the economic and social aspects, which should be the subject of further research.","This paper takes green landscape cultural ecological city theory and green living environment theory as the guide, improving the ecological quality as the goal, sustainability as the development strategy. The paper makes an analysis of building green landscape and cultural ecological protection system from three aspects, studies cultural of waterfront landscape in Gansu and artistic elements of Dunhuang. The aim of this research is to build clear, well-structured urban landscape of Gansu, effectively enhancing cultural of urban landscape of Gansu and finally creating a good environment for the social and economic development in Gansu Province. 1. Role of Gansu Province City's Cultural Soft Power Construction Gansu climatic conditions and limited water resources make the developments of the quality of the urban environment and urban transition tourism city be uncoordinated . Environmental problems have become more obvious, population growth, traffic congestion, air pollution, and so on ecological environmental problems manifested in varying degrees, seriously affecting the sustainable development of the city of Gansu. Currently, the lack of Gansu province city, the original variety of zoning organic coordination among themselves, cannot meet the ecological landscape construction process integrated development of land and water resources, efficient use and protection needs. Urban landscape and cultural soft power has become an important factor to measure the status of urban civilization and the modern city, how to use the limited urban land resources to achieve rational distribution of urban green landscape and cultural systems, to optimize the soft power of landscape spatial structure, reflecting the local culture is the city's soft power system fully and efficiently play its ecological and social benefits, it is very important. For building a tourist city, Gansu province city shall use hard power as base and soft power as attractive and appealing of the city. Urban culture and its building of soft power is an important aspect that should be indispensable. In recent years, Gansu province city’ tourism relying on the rich resources of cultural landscape gained rapid development. However, in terms of life-cycle theory of Gansu province city tourism image is still in the development stage, the first image perception is not clear; secondly is the tourism market has a low degree of recognition on the image and lack uniqueness. Therefore, Gansu urban landscape and cultural soft power research has important theoretical and practical significance. This article from Gansu province city landscape and cultural soft power to enhance the strategic point of view, discuss preliminary observations. 2. The Problem of Enhancing the Soft Power of Gansu Province City Cityscape cultural soft power is the value of urban living systems and their symbolic form of specific human community to the outside presents flexible attraction and appeal [3]. Beauty of a Gansu province city contains a \"weather, geography, history, customs, architecture, art\" and \"all beauty is ready\" and \"a collection of beauty.\" Mention of Gansu, people always think of beef noodles, carved gourds, clay art, sheepskin raft, paper cutting arts and so on. I assume the study process of the young science research projects in Gansu Jiaotong University, \"Enhancement of Gansu province disaster mitigation capacity building of cities green culture protection system\", basing on the relevant theory collect a variety of data, obtained in cooperation with relevant departments to collect profiles of Gansu province city area, including collection of natural 2018 International Conference on Arts, Linguistics, Literature and Humanities (ICALLH 2018) Copyright © (2018) Francis Academic Press, UK 147 conditions, socio-economic conditions and cultural science and technology information. Do related researches Basing on logical analysis, by comparison with the analogy, abstraction and generalization method, analysis and synthesis method, inductive and deductive logic, such as specific methods to explore the interior of the regularity of the urban landscape and cultural soft Gansu in-depth study of the strength of the system. Through on-site and site visits to gather information, the paper will determine public satisfaction survey focused on studies of Gansu province city waterfront landscape and cultural. Summarize Experience of the problems and achievements and success for the production of a detailed questionnaire conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data, the urban landscape of Gansu province city's cultural soft power system for research and demonstration. Follows. 2.1 Green Network System is Not Perfect Gansu Yellow River along the transport routes and forest green corridor landscape, patchy shelter, and not to scale systems, urban green spaces did not meet the ecological protection because of not forming network, poor connectivity and low road green coverage rate. Due to the low road green coverage rate of the city, difficult to form a green corridor and connect the city flake of green area, Ecological benefits of urban green space cannot play very well. Both sides of the river runs through the city, building densely, near the river, lack of covering vegetation, coupled with the river within the city limits and many more rigid construction materials lining, self-purification capacity of water bodies weak, waterfront natural ecological environment has been completely destroyed, the basic loss the river the role of biological corridor. Due to the lag of network construction of city green space, the city residents rarely use green space, and social benefit is low. 2.2 Urban Landscape Regional Characteristics are Not Distinctive Enough Urban landscape culture from the traditional damage results in reduced recognition and the lack of culture characteristics of urban landscape, hinders the sustainable development of the city. Urban landscape is often associated with the famous buildings, such as Beijing's Tiananmen square, the Imperial Palace and the Wangfujing street, Shanghai's Bund, the \"Oriental Pearl\" TV Tower and the Nanjing Road, Xi'an's big wild goose pagoda and the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, which have become signs and symbols of the city [4]. Gansu is the only one in the Yellow River through the city. Based on skeleton of \"two mountains and a river\", only Zhongshan bridge is famous for its strong local characteristics and profound history. However, the whole city is still a lack of landmark region of high grade culture, distinctive local characteristics. 2.3 The Shaping of Urban Landscape Lack Ecological Consciousness and Humanistic Care Gansu is relatively sensitive ecological area in ecological function zoning of Gansu province. Taking biodiversity and habitat as the main sensitive factors, it faces that problem that plant species is single and community structure is monotonous, unreasonable phenomenon in the construction of green landscape of cultural soft power, which is not conducive to the improvement of the ecological environment and sustainable development. Currently, urban Construction has too much emphasis on display and visual form to beautify the urban environment. Urban ecological environment quality also affects the degree of interference between the city, so it has a high demand on the protection forest system. At present, in Gansu the rate of forest coverage is low, mainly displays in: \"Forest patches\" and \"Lin Lang\" have no size; protection forest is not perfect. With the development of the city, the highway traffic had a serious impact on the ecological environment, atmospheric environment, acoustic environment, natural landscape. Most protection system on both sides do not become dimensions. On both sides of the railway forest is sparse, landscape is poor and protection ability is weak. 3. Countermeasures of Improving Soft Power in Gansu 3.1 Ecological Protection System Construction of Green Culture Landscape in Gansu Ecological landscape emphasizes the mutual relationship between the level of process and","A typology of urban vacant land was developed using Roanoke, Virginia, as the study area. Because of its industrial past, topography and climate, Roanoke provides a range of vacant land types typical of those in many areas of the Mid-Atlantic, Eastern and Midwestern United States. A comprehensive literature review, field measurements and observations analysis and aerial photo interpretation and ground-truthing methods were utilized to identify and catalog vacant parcels of land and the results were mapped using i-Tree Canopy to identify the following types of urban vacant land: post-industrial (3.34 km2), derelict (4.01 km2), unattended with vegetation (17.3 km2), natural (2.78 km2), and transportation-related (5.01 km2). Unattended with vegetation sites are important resources as the health biodiversity found in natural sites benefits urban populations and they represent the highest plantable space. The redesign of post-industrial sites builds a city’s image and transportation-related sites can contribute a green infrastructure network of open spaces. This typological study has significant implications for policy development, and for planners and designers seeking the best use for vacant urban land. The analysis of Roanoke’s urban forest revealed around 210,000 trees on vacant land, a tree cover of 30.6%. These trees store about 107,000 tons of carbon (worth $7.65 million) and remove about 2,300 tons of carbon ($164,000), and about 91 tons of air pollution ($916,000) every year, which is high relative to other land uses. Trees on vacant land are estimated to reduce annual residential energy costs by $211,000 for the city’s 97,000 residents and their structural value is estimated at $169 million. The methodology applied to assess ecosystem services in this study can also be used to assess ecosystem services of vacant land in other urban contexts and improve urban forest policies, planning, and the management of vacant land. The study findings support the inclusion of trees on vacant land providing a new vision of vacant urban land as a","..................................................................................................................................... 5 Introduction ................................................................................................................................ 6 1.

In South Africa, many cases of water pollution have been reported. This paper assesed the physical, chemical and microbial properties of water from three locations in a coal mining region of South Africa. A mixed-methods approach involving quantitative analysis of water and qualitative (interviews of participants) was empoyed. Samples were taken from two secondary schools taps and a river. A total number of eleven parameters were assessed and analysed using different analytical methods. The values of each of analyzed parameters were later compared with the South African National Standard (SANS) for drinking water quality. The findings reveal that majority of the parameters conformed to the recommended guidelines while others were either at the threshold limit or present in greater concentrations. It is to be noted that long-term exposure of any of these in water can result in a number of harmful effects as discussed in the paper.

This growing influx of people in the urban centres, as it is the case in many parts of the world, has subjected the urban infrastructure and other resources to untold pressure. Incidentally, the population dynamics and its associated anthropogenic activities have direct consequences on the integrity of the natural environment. It is clear that several human activities could be responsible for many environmental problems, including the wasteful depletion of natural resources as well as the destruction of the natural habitats, thus contributing to the loss of biodiversity (Ali et al. 2017; Cloete et al. 2017; Sánchez-Bayo et al. 2016). In South Africa, similar environmental problems emanating from human activities are also encountered. Water pollution and scarcity, for instance, remains an important challenge, especially to the rural dwellers (Edokpayi et al. 2018; Elumalai et al. 2017). In many instances, communities in the vicinity of mining sites, especially coal mines suffer the most because of exposure to the negative effects of these mining activities (Dontala et al. 2015; Mhlongo and Amponsah-Dacosta 2016; Schneider 2015). For example, contaminated water from coal mines and other mining activities generally referred to as acid mine drainage may contain high levels of heavy metals thereby posing a great danger to the general ecosystem (Bwapwa et al. 2017). Besides the increasingly high incidences of atmospheric pollution in these areas, the pollution of water sources via discharges from these mining sites is significant (Butler 2017; Elumalai et al. 2017; Cloete et al. 2017). In fact, it was previously reported that population growth and rapid urbanisation contributed to the water pollution problems and thus had continued be a great challenge to the South African water resources (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016). Water is of basic importance to human physiology because man’s continual existence depends on its availability. Therefore, access to good quality drinking water is essential for everyone (Edokpayi et al. 2018). Countless numbers of people die yearly as a result of drinking contaminated water (World Health Organisation 2017). Specifically, another report of the World Health Organisation reveals that “......over 2.6 billion people lack access to clean water, which Ethno Med, 12(4): 229-238 (2018) DOI: 10.31901/24566772.2018/12.04.331 © Kamla-Raj 2018 230 ADEJOKE C. OLUFEMI, ANDILE MJI AND MUREMBIWA S. MUKHOLA is responsible for about 2.2 million deaths annually, of which 1.4 million are children.....” (Pandey et al. 2014: 2). This scenario is often related to water pollution mainly caused by discharges of industrial effluents and human wastes into water bodies (Elumalai et al. 2017). To substantiate the above claims, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that “...there is a global deterioration of water quality as a result of heavy metals concentration which has direct impact on human health and environment.....” (Ali et al. 2017: 2). Concerns about the health and aesthetic effects of water pollution are enormous. These may include the alteration of the physical appearance of the water, prevalence of pathogenic micro-organisms and increasing levels of harmful chemicals that can elicit serious health conditions in humans (Haseena et al. 2017; Rossouw and Görgens 2016). The presence of certain microorganisms such as total coliform and E.coli in water samples serves as a good indicator of faecal pollution. Many of the South African water resources are reported to have been contaminated by faecal matter and many cases of diseases due to exposure to this contaminated water have been documented (Rossouw and Görgens 2016; Osuolale and Okoh 2017). In fact according to the Department of Water and Sanitation, “....An estimated R3.5 billion is spent in South Africa every year as a direct result of diarrhoea.....” (Rossouw and Görgens 2016: 26). These microorganisms have been widely explored for this purpose and their presence needs to be strictly monitored to prevent further water-related disease outbreak (Saxena et al. 2015; Osuolale and Okoh","With its multiple dimensions and functions, urban agriculture has the potential to contribute to a sustainable urban development process, depending on how it is executed and who is included. In this study, we promoted multi-stakeholder dialogue about the outlook of urban agriculture in Maputo and Cape Town in form of interviews, meetings, field visits, farmers’ meetings and scenario-building workshops. The goal was to create a common vision with the different actors – farmers and gardeners, non-governmental organizations, social movements, enterprises, scientists and policy makers – and to develop strategic measures for positive change that served as the basis for formulating recommendations. In Maputo, thousands of smallholder farmers are well-organized and there are many actors who have the will to promote agriculture within the city. However, the political institutions that deal with urban agriculture lack commitment to address urban agricultural issues. Therefore, we propose a set of strategies that range from the creation of multidisciplinary working groups to the mapping of available arable land in the city. On the other hand, although the level of political institutionalization is much higher in Cape Town – a city with a big variety of different urban gardens and fields, we found that the focus of most stakeholders on resilient urban food systems is not well approached. The recommendations build on a range of strategies from the conduction of workshops about logistics for small-holder farmers to the creation of awareness on ecological issues, fair food production and conscious consumption. Problem statement and study objectives A growing human population and rapid urbanization make sustainable planning of urban areas one of the most challenging issues of the 21st century. Cities must meet many different needs of citizens, including housing, infrastructure, income generation, health, social justice and the enormous demand on the urban food system. We assume that urban agriculture can play a role as part of a sustainable development towards resilient cities and urban food systems. Short transportation routes that bring food to the consumer, income generation for the producer, an increase of biodiversity and air quality due to more green spaces in the city and the possibility for citizens to get involved in community projects in xxvi Executive summary their neighborhoods are only some of the examples of possible positive impacts of urban agriculture on its environment. However, urban planners and political decision makers are often not prepared to integrate urban agriculture into cities’ plans for the future. Because land in and around cities is limited and manifold alternative uses are possible, urban agriculture is often threatened by competition for land and has to take place under semi-legal and precarious conditions. The potential lies in overcoming those constraints by mediating these different interests. Hence, we created a participatory stakeholder dialogue with the goal of creating a common vision among the key actors and analyzed the necessary conditions for the sustainable future of urban agriculture in Maputo and Cape Town. We always tried to build upon pre-existing research, institutional structures and processes. We gathered key actors, from farmers to policy makers, to discuss the future role of urban agriculture within and beyond the urban food system. Conceptual framework and local context Urban agriculture is an umbrella term for different types of agriculture and horticulture within (intra-urban) or on the fringe (peri-urban) of a city which grows or raises, processes, and distributes a diversity of food and non-food products. It (re-)uses largely human resources and products to provide services for the local environment with multifunctional ecological, socio-cultural, sanitary and economic impacts (Halder, 2018, p. 113; Mougeot 2000). Studies estimate that over 800 million people practice urban agriculture worldwide (Hoornweg &amp; Munro-Faure, 2008, p. 22). Due to disparities of the local context in Cape Town and Maputo and their urban agriculture practices, the particularities of each city are described below, as the project strongly focuses on the specific needs of local actors and considered existing local structures. Urban agriculture plays an important role in the city of Maputo, especially regarding the economic dimension. The agricultural sector employs about 66,200 people directly and is responsible for 8 percent of the city’s gross income. Moreover, urban agriculture in Maputo provides food for 22 % of households (White &amp; Hamm, 2017). Farmers in Maputo are small-holders peasant. They produce mainly fast growing vegetables like lettuce and kale, which are usually purchased directly by intermediaries in or near the fields and sold on local markets, leaving small profit margin for the farmers. One particularity of the capital city are the zonas verdes, extensive green belts in the urban and peri-urban area. Most producers are affiliated with associations and cooperatives. Some of Executive summary xxvii the challenges they face are inappropriate and extensive use of agro-chemicals and salinization of soil. With respect to the political framework, there is little governmental protection for land used for agricultural purposes and no differentiation between rural and urban agricultural activities. Cape Town has a diverse urban agriculture scene that includes different farmers, gardeners, NGOs, social movements, private enterprises, governmental actors, research institutions and other stakeholders. Likewise, the types of farming practiced is also diverse. In the Cape Flats, the predominant forms of agricultural practice are home and community gardens. Approximately 4,000 home gardens (with a size of Ø 6-12 m2) and approximately 100 community gardens (with a size of Ø 600 m2) produce a variety of horticultural products which are either consumed by the producers themselves or, to a small degree, marketed with the support of NGOs in the form of vegetable boxes sold to households, as well as to “lifestyle markets” and trendy restaurants in the city center (Dolch, 2017). In the Philippi Horticulture Area and in the peri-urban areas, bigger commercial farms prevail. The urban farmland of the Philippi Horticulture Area produces 100,000 tons of fresh produce annually on 3,000 hectares. Urban agriculture in Cape Town plays an important multifunctional role, ranging from providing food to building communities creating spaces for environmental education. But the challenges urban farmers face, threaten the continuity and sustainability of this practices. For instance, little legal protection or land rights for the agricultural land in the city, the urban food insecurity in general, the situation of climate change, water scarcity and restrictions, as well as a lack of training and experience. Research framework and methodology Our project is part of the interdisciplinary research project Urban Agriculture for Food Security and Income Generation in South Africa and Mozambique (UFISAMO), implemented by a consortium of German, Mozambican, and South African universities, state departments and civil society organizations. The main goals of the UFISAMO project are to contribute to improved food and nutrition security of the poor urban population and to increase income generation by optimizing production, processing and marketing of agricultural and livestock products. This is done through the different working packages (WP) such as value chains analysis (WP1), risks and benefits of crop production and livestock production (WP2), a research and education network (WP3), as well as the transfer of research results into practice and policies (WP4). xxviii Executive summary Our work lies between the WP3 and WP4, thus one of the main objectives of this study was to strengthen the dialogue between different key actors in Maputo and Cape Town (i.e. producers, NGOs, research organizations, government and policy agencies, and the private sector) to foster cooperation between these stakeholders and create a common understanding of different aims and interests, as well as a joint vision for urban agriculture. Another essential objective of this study was developing recommendations for strategic interventions that support integrating urban agriculture into a sustainable development process for the cities of Cape Town and Maputo. The most important basis for the specific recommendations made was the input of participants in the participatory workshops we organized, one farmers’ meeting and one scenario building workshop in each city. This was complemented by literature review, the analysis of the political framework, interests of the different key actors, good practices from other cities and expert interviews. This combination allowed us to give suitable recommendations tailored to the local context, while also leveraging existing local structures and knowledge. Results and recommendations The potential of Maputo’s urban agriculture lies in the existence of extensive green zones dedicated to agriculture in the city and the organizational structure of farmers in associations. Indeed, this potential can be leveraged through strategic measures, ranging from the creation of transversal working groups to deal with the multi-dimensional aspects of urban agriculture to concrete technical solutions like the mapping of available arable land in the city. According to the workshop participants, the following challenges and recommendations are those considered the most important to resolve and initiate:","We are pleased to inaugurate in this issue our Special Feature section. The focus chosen for this first feature is some remarkable Characeae in Europe. This taxon belongs to the Charophyta, an exciting freshwater algal group that has a sister position to land plants among Embryophyta (Lewis and McCourt 2004). The idea of a special issue has emerged as a consequence of the recent discovery of new locations for Tolypella salina, a very rare taxon, of which the distribution is restricted to a few Spanish and French sites. The interest of the Société botanique de France in the Characeae is a long-standing one, through contributions based on flora inventory activity in France [Tolypella hispanica Nordst (Offner 1923) or Tolypella prolifera von Leonh. (Guerlesquin 1961)], in Cyprus where our members discovered Lamprothamnium papulosum (Wallr.) J. Groves during a field trip (Alziar and Guittonneau 2004), or in Belgium (Compère 1999), and through studies on the physiology and genetics (Grant and Proctor 1991; Feist, Bhatia and Yadagiri 1991; Ray 1991; McCourt et al 1999; Simo Santalla et al. 1999; Soulié-Märsche 1999), the ecology and the habitats (Guerlesquin, Sulmont and Wattez 1991; Moore 1991) or through provision of scientific support to promote the conservation of some of their habitats (Guerlesquin and Lambert-Servien 1999). This interest stems mainly from the work of one of our members, Professor Robert Corillion (1908–1997), a distinguished botanist of the Bretagne and Anjou regions (Guerlesquin 1999), author of the first discovery and description of Tolypella salina (Corillion 1960) and a great contributor to our knowledge of the distribution of Characeae in northwestern France (Corillion 1947, 1949, 1952a, 1952b, 1953). A synthesis of all his work (Guerlesquin 1999) was presented in a special issue of volume 12 of the Journal de Botanique dedicated to his work through the presentation of communications given during the Conference organized in his honour by members of his laboratory, in Angers, on the 29 and 30 April 1999 with the partnership of the French Botanical Society. The Characeae still represent a major scientific challenge in the context of water quality issues (Krause 1981; AFNOR 2003; Pełechaty, Pukasz and Pełechata. 2004; Stelzer, Schneider and Melzer 2005) or conservation management (Van den Berg et al. 1998; Barker et al. 2008). A number of studies point to a tendency towards a decrease, especially within the rarest species, and a restriction of Characeae-rich habitats (Simons and Nat 1996; Auderset-Joye, Castella and Lachavanne 2002). Some countries have Red Lists of Charophytes (AudersetJoye and Schwarzer 2012; Korsch et al. 2012); However, the information in the literature on the distribution and ecological conditions of certain species is still scattered, as shown by some of the articles in this issue. Our next special feature will be on quantitative genetics and is due in the next issue, 160(3): manuscripts can still be received until 31 August 2013. Any suggestions for future special issues would be welcomed by the editors. We are also pleased to announce the publication of selected articles providing an overview of the issues addressed during the 2013 Ninth Plant Community Ecology meeting, ECOVEG 9, in a future issue of ABG Botany Letters, due at the beginning of 2014. ECOVEG 9 took place at the University François Rabelais of Tours (France) from 3 to 5 April 2013, and was organized by the IPAPE (UMR 7324 CNRS CITERES) laboratory. It was a great occasion that gathered together both young and confirmed research scientists working in the field of community ecology. Indeed, plant communities are the cornerstones of ecosystem functioning and have fascinating characteristics that have stimulated researchers in ecology for at least 60 years. This issue will contain articles dealing with the following main subject areas: community patterns of species richness and diversity; communitybased ecological theory; temporal dynamics, including succession; biotic interactions, including competition, facilitation and plant–animal interactions; spatial pattern analysis, including scaling issues. Both terrestrial and water systems (wetlands, freshwater, marine) will be addressed, from natural to urban environments. We welcome submissions before 31 October. The Société botanique de France has endorsed the 2 International Congress of Plant Biodiversity, which will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, from 27 to 29 March 2014, on the theme of Plant biodiversity in the context of climate change and biotechnology progresses: challenges and perspectives. It is being organized by several major Moroccan scientific institutions and the Acta Botanica Gallica: Botany Letters, 2013 Vol. 160, No. 2, 103–105, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.2013.825466","Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been successfully used, since its emergence in the 1990s, to model and simulate the dynamics at work in complex socio-environmental systems, in many domains and applications where interactions between people and their environments give rise to emergent phenomena that are difficult to study otherwise (urban planning, land-use change, adaptation to environmental changes, biodiversity protection in socio-ecosystems, environmental pollution control, etc.). The inclusion of multiple levels of analysis, abstraction, and representation in these models, however, is much more recent and is still the subject of many proposals and discussions within a relatively informal field, Multilevel Agent-Based Modeling (ML-ABM), which is most often presented as an approach that extends the classical ABM paradigm to include multilevel concepts. Over the past decade, ML-ABM has been increasingly adopted and explored by researchers as an effective paradigm for framing and defining the mechanisms underlying multilevel dynamics. However, due to the youth of the field, no single definition, methodology, or tool unifies studies in this rapidly expanding area. This review will begin with an introduction to socio-environmental systems (SES) and the challenges that modeling approaches face in representing them properly, especially regarding the complexity of human behaviors and organizations. ABM presents opportunities for modeling SESs with respect to these challenges, including the simulation of individual and social behavior and their ability to provide a descriptive and generative representation of the simulated system. However, ABM is limited in its ability to represent levels and scales, as these concepts are absent from the classical ABM metamodel. A complete review of the ML-ABM literature will be carried out, structured around a continuum that emerged during the review: that of the distribution of behaviors (and thus, from a software engineering perspective, of control) across the levels, from approaches that allow only one level to be active at a time, to approaches that rely on simultaneous activity and feedback loops between several levels. Different design choices will, thus, be presented to meet the different needs of multi-level representation, focusing on the interest on modelers and the strengths and limitations of each. In particular, we will highlight a limitation shared by all the reviewed approaches, namely their inability to represent several parallel hierarchies of levels and their interactions, a capability that appears more and more crucial to finely represent social behaviors in SES. A new perspective on the interest that the AGR approach could represent to allow this representation of hierarchies allows us to conclude on the research perspectives are still open.","PEMEX Urban Park is an urban regeneration project focused on the remediation and reclamation of PEMEX’s brownfield and the adjacent natural lagoon ‘Laguna La Escondida’ located in the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The 65-hectare brownfield is strategically located within the urban center, one of the causes of high levels of air and water pollutants in the city. Historically, the presence of the oil refinery generated dystopic neighbourhoods, some with no access to public spaces, others with inadequate conditions for any type of sustainable community engagement. The natural lagoon, the ‘Laguna La Escondida’, is a 152-hectare body of water, contaminated by toxic metals and chemicals produced by the refinery and the city’s uncontrolled rapid growth. Although contaminated, the lagoon is an essential resource for many local floras and migrating species of fauna. This study includes a thorough analysis of comparable precedents of industrial heritage sites, their associated values and strategies of transformation of polluted landscapes, demonstrating the needs of a broader urban-hydro-ecological approach, emerging from the desire to revive and reintegrate nature into the city. Site analysis and case studies also highlight the important role of culture, of the history embedded in the place, as well as the communities interlinked with the oil refinery. The project, implementing the transformation of PEMEX oil refinery into an urban park, will keep the refinery infrastructure untouched as a memory of the past, acting as a catalyst for eco-socio-cultural activities, providing the community with a place to reconnect as a civic society. The proposal enhances the inherent values of the site, such as history, culture and nature. While purification of water is the focus of this new urban-hydro-ecological proposal, the research suggests alternative remediation strategies that will reverse the damage without compromising future generations’ wellbeing. Phytoremediation and rhizo-filtration strategies are analysed as a technique to clean the toxins and heavy metals from the contaminated soil and water. The bioremediation of the lagoon would increase water-quality and reinstate the biodiversity. PEMEX Urban Park envisions an urban eco-hydrological future of the area and re-imagine it as a social condenser in response to capitalism as a form of urbanization.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nEuropean mesic meadows are semi-natural open habitats of high biodiversity and an essential part of European landscapes. These species-rich communities can be a source of seed mixes for ecological restoration, urban greening and rewilding. However, limited knowledge of species germination traits is a bottleneck to the development of a competitive native seed industry. Here, we synthesize the seed ecology of mesic meadows.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe combined our own experimental data with data obtained from databases to create a combined dataset containing 2,005 germination records of 90 plant species from 31 European countries. We performed a Bayesian meta-analysis of this dataset to test the seed germination response to environmental cues including scarification, stratification, temperature, alternating temperature and light. We also used multivariate ordination to check the relationship between seed traits (germination and morphology) and species ecological preferences, and to compare the seed ecology of mesic meadows with that of other herbaceous plant communities from the same area.\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nThe seed ecology of mesic meadows is characterized by (1) high seed germinability when compared to other herbaceous plant communities; (2) low correspondence between seed traits and species ecological preferences; and (3) a deep phylogenetic separation between the two major families, Poaceae and Fabaceae. Poaceae produce many light seeds which respond to gap-detecting germination cues (alternating temperatures and light); Fabaceae produce fewer heavy seeds, which need scarification to break their physical dormancy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh germinability of meadow seeds will reduce their capacity to form persistent seed banks, resulting in dispersal limitations to passive regeneration. For centuries, human activities have shaped the regeneration of meadows, leading to a loss of seed dormancy and decoupling seeds from seasonal cycles, as has been found in many domesticated species. The same anthropic processes that have shaped semi-natural mesic meadows have left them dependent on continued human intervention for their regeneration, highlighting the importance of active restoration via seed supply.","Rivers and reservoirs in urban areas have been associated with environmental quality problems because of the discharge of domestic waste into water bodies. However, the key effects and the extent to which environmental factors can influence the integrated structure and function of urban river ecosystems remain largely unknown. Here, a relationship model involving the species composition of the community and the various environmental factors related to the water and sediment was developed in the dry season (N) and the flood season (F) in both the urban Jiaomen River (JR) and the Baihuitian Reservoir (BR) of Guangzhou City. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to determine the spatiotemporal drivers of the phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrobenthic communities in the river and reservoir systems. The combination of the thermodynamic-oriented ecological indicators and the biodiversity measures reflected the integrated structure and function of the ecosystems. Overall, the plankton community composition was found to be largely determined by the nutrient concentrations and oxygen index, and the development of the macrobenthic communities was mainly restricted by organic matter and heavy metals. Based on the results of the integrated assessment, the structure and function of the JR ecosystem were superior to that of the BR, and the F period displayed healthier results than the N period. Moreover, the structural and functional statuses of the high eco-exergy grade communities (macrobenthic communities) in the ecosystem influenced the regional changes observed in the results of the integrated assessment. The significant seasonal variations in the plankton community affected the seasonal variations in the integrated assessment. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the management and restoration of regional freshwater environments and ecosystems.","In the last few decades European industrial cities have experienced major transformations which have implied the need to rethink the role of nature. Re-naturing the city, reconnecting urban planning and nature and enhancing sustainability, means taking into account ecosystems and biodiversity through a social approach to nature which reconsiders nature as a social product and re-examines city–nature relationships, the way Urban Political Ecology (UPE) suggests. This paper focuses on the Brescia Quarry Park, a suburban space that until just a few years ago was characterized by mining activities. This area has now been transformed into a re-naturalized area and is projected to become one of Europe’s largest re-naturalized protected urban areas. These transformations are signs of a profound change in the urban metabolism. In fact, the community has struggled for many years for the recognition of the value of the area in ecological and cultural terms. Therefore, an approach was adopted based on Urban Political Ecology, which is useful to study how the socio–natural relationships change and how an exploited and degraded land can become a relevant natural area from the local community’s point of view. This approach also allowed us to study conflicts due to unequal power relations and strategies developed by the community to reduce these conflicts. Particular interest was given to the participatory processes which have driven these transformations and to the role played by the different actors involved through top-down and bottom-up approaches. So, we decided to combine UPE and participatory action research—PAR and create a participatory map of the Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) in the Park. Attention was given to understanding the practices of the stakeholders and benefits for the community. This involvement allowed us to represent the complexity of the re-naturalized urban landscape which was analyzed through the changes in natural, urban and rural features that emerged. During the process, the interaction between citizens and experts was fundamental in co-producing an analysis of the placemaking of urban landscapes and in revealing the socio–ecological interactions of the stakeholders with these places. The results of the mapping process represent a first step towards promoting sustainable environmental planning and management based on the involvement and empowerment of the local population.","Urban green space is a network of natural and semi-natural features in a harmonious \norder that enhances human well-being, increases ecosystem resilience, and contributes to \nbiodiversity conservation. The decreasing urban green spaces in our present-day cities \nare recognised to be a source of dissatisfaction in urban life. This negative scenario has \ngiven rise to the subsequent deterioration of urban quality of live which has impact on \nthe overall well-being of urban population. This research did a systematic study of local \ngovernment green spaces policy for social wellbeing in selected areas of Malaysia. The \nspecific objectives of the research were to analyse planning policy related to urban green \nspace provision in Peninsular Malaysia and to determine urban green space impacts on \nsocial well-being in Putrajaya. The research used a mixed method research approach. A \nqualitative document analysis of five selected planning instruments which guide \nphysical development in Peninsular Malaysia was conducted. In examining the policy \ndocuments, several variables namely open space, natural areas, green corridors, and \nconservation were used. Each policy documents was scored from one to three points for \neach variable. In analysing the result of qualitative document analysis, systematic policy \nanalysis was conducted following the model developed by Weiner and Vinings, which \nindicates the need for the rigorous implementation of urban green space policies. The \nstudy found that the provision of corridor or urban trails was given the least priority by \nthe policies, while the protection of natural areas was accorded greater emphasis. The \nprovision of urban green spaces and conservation of flora and fauna were given equal \nconsideration by the policies. The policies analysed were comprehensive in covering \nurban green space provision in Malaysia but the present supply of urban green space was \nbelow the policy requirement of providing two hectares of urban green open space to \nevery one thousand urban residents in Peninsular Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was \nalso conducted in four selected green open spaces in Putrajaya. The survey results were \nanalysed using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics \nexplained the socio-demographic information of respondent, while Pearson moment \ncorrelation analysis was performed to show relationship and direction of relation between two variables. Linear regression analysis was also conducted to determine \nwhich of the variables of urban green space (quality, quantity, and accessibility) are \npredictors of health promotion and satisfaction resulted from visiting urban green spaces \nin Putrajaya. Similarly, in predicting well-being which resulted from visiting urban \ngreen spaces, health promotion and satisfaction are used as independent variables. The \nresults found that, visitation of urban green spaces contributed significantly to \nimprovement of human well-being. The findings of this work indicated that, \naccessibility to urban green spaces had no statistical significance towards health \npromotion in Putrajaya. However, accessibility had a unique contribution to the \nsatisfaction of the visitors of urban green spaces in Putrajaya, which is the most unique \ncontributor of human well-being. The findings of the policy analysis indicated a need for \nthe provision of more urban green open spaces in the majority of urban areas analysed in \nSelangor state. The study concluded that good quality, sufficient quantity, and well \naccessible urban green spaces should be provided to the urban population as those places \ncould help the well-being of urban residents. In addition to overcoming lack of urban \ngreen spaces, the existing policies should promote creation of green corridors which \nwould add to accessibility of urban green spaces and aesthetic quality of urban built \nenvironment.","The prospect of decline in biological diversity has become a central concern in the life sciences, both around the world and across the United States. Anthropogenic disturbance has been identified as a major factor affecting species diversity trends. An increase in the harvesting of naturally diverse timber stands in the South has become an important issue. The ultimate impact of this high, and increasing, level of disturbance on tree species diversity in forests of the Southern United States is uncertain. We offer a brief review of literature related to major points in the development of species diversity concepts over the last 100 years. This is followed by a case study that makes use of periodic U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from Mississippi. Our interest, for southern forests, is whether tree species richness has declined, increased, or remained essentially stable over the last 35 years. We find that tree species richness has declined by 11 percent across Mississippi since 1977. However, in FIA plots that had no evidence of harvesting, tree species richness increased by 44 percent since 1967. It is difficult to determine what constitutes a healthy level of tree species richness for particular sample designs and large-scale State surveys. Additional analytical complexity comes from the lack of documentation and knowledge concerning various levels of richness dynamics for large spatial and temporal scale studies. INTRODUCTION Questions about, concerns about, and interests in biological diversity have reached high levels of priority with academics, research scientists, resource conservationists, political decisionmakers, civic leaders, and interested members of the general public (particularly those in the environmental community). Though biological diversity has been of interest to ecologists for many decades, broader popular interest in the subject developed in the 1980s in response to the highly publicized exploitation and deforestation of tropical rain forests (Wilson and Peter 1988). This disturbance takes the form of intensive and extensive timber harvesting and land clearing. Heightened public interest in biological diversity and the decline of tropical forests was reflected in the 1986 National Forum on Biodiversity (Wilson and Peter 1988). Anthropogenic disturbance on forest land in the United States, and its long-term effects on forest biology, has also received considerable attention (Hunter 1999, Kimmins 1997, Kohm and Franklin 1997, Maser 1994, Noss and Cooperrider 1994, Perry 1994, Szaro and Johnston 1996). The types of disturbance range from permanent clearing, as in the conversion of forest land to urban or agricultural use (in this context permanent may mean only a few years to many decades), to intense and repeated harvesting activity. Increases in timber harvesting in the Southern United States has raised concerns about the longterm sustainable (both productive and ecologically sound) use of the forest resource. The concept of sustainable use is different from its predecessor, sustainable yield, in that equal weight is given to biological, social, economic, and political components, whereas sustainable yield matches levels and rates of harvesting with maximum rates of species production. See Campbell (2002) for more background on sustainability. 1 Research Forester, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Knoxville, TN 37919; and Professor, University of Tennessee, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Knoxville, TN 37996, respectively. So ut he rn F or es t Sc ie nc e: Pa st , P re se nt , a nd F ut ur e Bi od iv er si ty 336 Increases in timber harvesting on private land in the Southern United States have resulted primarily from a combination of consumer demands and reductions in the amount of publiclands timber being offered for contract sales. The latter follows from reductions in the allowable sale quantity [the amount of timber offered for sale on national forests by the USDA Forest Service (Forest Service)]. These reductions in timber being offered for sale can be attributed to issues related to habitat protection (as for the spotted owl in the Northwestern United States), reductions in budget and staff, and increases in the amount of time and money expended in litigation (Kohm and Franklin 1997). The result is that less timber is being removed from national forest lands, particularly in the West. The Southern United States is making up much of the shortfall in western timber production by increasing harvests on forest industry and nonindustrial private forest lands. Currently, the Southern United States accounts for 65 percent of all tree volume harvested in the United States (Smith and others 2001). This is a substantial increase since 1992, when the South contributed 55 percent of all harvested volume (Powell and others 1993). The issues of sustainable forests and sustainable forestry involve both shortand long-term impacts. An example of short-term impacts would be timber supply shortages while long-term impacts reflect the integrity of forest biology. The latter include, but are not limited to, soil deterioration, habitat destruction and alteration, changes in stand structure, successional interruptions, stand fragmentation, declines in old-growth area, age-class imbalance, changes in species composition, and impacts on overall biological diversity. Noss (1996) has identified seven types of biotic impoverishment in forests. These can be thought of as trajectories of change as the dynamics of natural forest processes are shifted by more intense management. The changes are: older stands to younger stands, structurally and compositionally complex stands to simple stands, large continuous forests to smaller fragmented patches, forest stands that are in close proximity to each other (or are continuous with) to increasingly isolated patches, frequent cool fires to fewer hot fires, few roads to many roads, and stable species populations to more endangered species. Any of these factors may occur independently or in combination. As forest harvesting activity in the Southern United States continues to increase, decisionmakers will need reliable information that tracks the impact of harvesting on forest resource integrity. In order to evaluate the long-term impact of intense timber harvesting, decisionmakers need to know how tree species diversity and overall forest composition may be affected. The effect an increasing area of artificially regenerated forest stands will have on species diversity over a large area, such as a State, is a related concern. For conservation strategies to be effective, reliable information about species diversity trends must be available. Traditional ecological studies have in most cases dealt with smaller areas. However, extrapolations from smallscale, independent, and scattered studies do not provide adequate and reliable information about conditions and processes over large spatial scales. The study of biological diversity is not new. This chapter presents a brief chronological review of the diversity concept as it has developed in the United States over the last century. We then discuss preliminary findings of a large-scale diversity assessment for an extensive forest area in the Southern United States, along with considerations that are important when applying such assessments over large geographic regions. A case study based on data from recent forest surveys of Mississippi is used to illustrate a method of tracking tree species richness over time. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE DIVERSITY CONCEPT IN THE UNITED STATES Much of the species diversity work after the 1950s was aimed at devising new mathematical methods for quantifying diversity assessments. This review does not cover the broad range of studies devoted exclusively to that subject. Additionally, a general lack of standardization in the terminology may cause some confusion. In this chapter, we use the terms richness and species diversity interchangeably, but we recognize that richness is one type of measurement attribute describing species diversity (Magurran 1988, Pielou 1974). Richness has traditionally been defined as the number of species occurring in a specific area. This area may be small or large. It is important to understand how the richness measure (or any other species diversity measure) is obtained because results obtained from applying different sample designs to the same sample population have differed considerably (Diserud and Aagaard 2002). Earlier, the concept of species diversity was regarded as a historical phenomenon related to the accumulation of species over time (Fischer","The 21st century is currently undergoing an era of urban regeneration. The purpose of this research is to secure and expand the green infrastructure with zoning regulation in the context of urban regeneration. This objective also seeks a way of urban regeneration through the use of existing large parks by employing park-based mixed use districts around the periphery of large urban parks and green spaces. This research examines the limits, problems of existing single- and mixed-use zoning districts for securing of green infrastructure by book review. This research finally advocates introducing a another type of urban mixed-use districts, namely park-based mixed use district and its characteristics and functions, by using landscape ecology and landscape urbanism as a theoretical basis. The results of this research suggested that large parks and green spaces should be considered as one of patch in landscape ecology. This research also discusses the possibility that, as patches have ecotones with greater biodiversity in the peripheral areas of it, the green infrastructure can be constructed around the periphery of large urban large parks and green spaces by introducing cultural ecotone of nature's convergence with the city. As a result, the green infrastructure and high density of land use and using behaviour can be increased. Park-based mixed use districts encourage the convergence of parks and the city, with the park being used as the main function; residential, commercial, business and cultural uses etc. are partial functions. In order for the park-based mixed use districts to be designated, the size of large urban parks and green spaces, as well as location, city function and condition of the peripheral areas all need to be considered. The necessity to examine the designated width of the park-based mixed use districts and the form of the peripheral area was also discussed. This research, which is based on investigative research results, suggests that further in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the actual condition of urban large parks and peripheral areas needs to be completed. Specialists and other interested parties, analysis and investigation on related plans and designs are also needed for the institutional practice.","Fire is historically important in moulding moorland and heathland landscapes. Managed rotational burning is used to maintain heather moors for grouse and grazing animals. In contrast, wildfire ??? accidental or malicious vegetation fire ??? increasingly threatens ecosystem services (ES). The environmental, social and cultural ES provided by moorlands and heathlands include carbon capture and storage (especially on peatland), biodiversity, water provision, flood protection, aesthetic/recreational value, and economic value from tourism, sporting enterprises, forestry and grazing. The series discussed the key but equivocal role of prescribed fire and wildfire, and the many controversies for management and policy making, notably in the policy panel at FIRES4. The impact of fire on biodiversity, carbon budget and water colour is controversial. A key concept is that impact varies with fire regime, that is, with frequency, intensity and severity (itself a contested term), yet most research relates to single fires. New work is needed on changing fire regimes and their impact on ES. Ecological impact also depends on the baseline, time scale for recovery and management objectives. We need to know the optimum fire regimes to manage different ES, and how to prioritise between them.Management of wildfire risk requires a combination of: fuel load reduction; reducing risk of ignition from human sources, such as controlling pubic access or urban expansion; increasing resilience of vegetation to dry conditions; and improving suppression. Fuel load management is critical. Managed fires can reduce wildfire risk by reducing fuel load, although if poorly controlled can become wildfires. Our speakers from Mediterranean countries stressed that complete fire suppression and land abandonment had allowed fuel load to increase, resulting in more severe fires. Current UK land management policy is also allowing fuel loads to become dangerously high. There is a need to review policies which prevent fuel load management, or even to reward land managers who reduce wildfire hazard indirectly protecting ES from wildfire. Wildfire hazard reduction should be recognised as a significant ???natural??? hazard in the UK. Including ???WF prevention??? as an ES on the DEFRA impact grid. The FIRES4 workshop encouraged recognition of complex cross-sector impacts with other ES. A full impact pathway analysis is needed.Climate change is likely to mean more summer droughts and more frequent severe wildfires like those of 2003 and 1976. Warmer wetter winters are likely to bring increased fuel accumulation and fewer suitable days for prescribed burns. Research is needed on these and other complex effects of climate change on fuel, as well as on visitor numbers and other human responses. We need to know more about public attitudes to fire. Adaptive management, monitoring and frequent policy review will be required.Fire and Rescue Services??? (FRS) priority are structural fires, but there is growing concern about wildfires, as evidenced by the Scottish an English Wildfire Forums. Most FRS are poorly equipped and trained to deal with vegetation fires. Research and knowledge exchange on UK fire behaviour, especially for peat fires, is needed to improve the efficiency of fire suppression. Improved forecasting and modelling tools are required, adapted to UK conditions. The UK needs a much better evidence base. The new Incident Recording System requires a UK-wide standard for reporting vegetation fires, especially their spatial location. Moorland wildfires are spatial scale events often lasting several days. They are costly and challenge FRS resilience to tackle other incidents. Prevention and suppression costs need to be set against the cost of avoided damage to ES. This requires a viable valuation mechanism for ES. Treating moorland and heathland ES as property assets with a monetary value would move wildfires up the FRS priority order of life, property and environment. Partnership working in Local Fire Groups is an efficient and effective grass roots approach to the wildfire issue. It should be supported by central government.The four seminars created a vibrant cross-sector multidisciplinary forum. Practitioners comprised more than half the audience. The series brought together over 130 researchers, policy-makers, FRS officers, land managers and other stakeholders. It was the first time the FRS had been involved in coordinated academic debate on UK wildfires. A policy brief is being prepared. FIRES raised awareness of the UK wildfire problem and its significance for ES. A clear need for further interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange has been demonstrated.","Based on a request made by the French Ministry in charge of the Environment (MTES), an EKLIPSE \n Expert Working Group (EEWG) was formed to answer the following questions: \n “Which types of urban and suburban blue and green spaces and which characteristics (components) \n of such spaces have a significant impact on human mental health and well-being?” \n The EEWG will try to answer these questions as comprehensively as possible based on the scientific \n literature and the resources available. No new primary research will be conducted. The answers will \n be interpreted and discussed in the light of climate change. \n \n Given that the EEWG has very limited resources (for up to three meetings of the EWG only) and its \nexperts will not be compensated for the time they put in, the original intention of the EEWG was to \nconduct a rapid evidence assessment (REA). \nRecently, the EEWG has agreed with the WHO to perform a full systematic review (SR) on this topic. \nWHO will provide a budget to have skilled librarians conduct a structured literature search for the \nEEWG to work on. \nTherefore, this EKLIPSE protocol, which describes the activities to be undertaken by the EEWG to \nanswer the request (this document), is based on performing a SR. It includes discussing the \nimplications of the results of the SR for how climate change may affect the future provision of the \necosystem service of mental health promotion. \n \nThis SR will rather unique in that it focuses on the type of green (and blue) space and its other \n characteristics. Previous reviews have been mainly focused on research on the local amount and \navailability of, or access to green (and to a much lesser extent) blue space, and not on its qualities. \nIt may also be noted that the issue of the type and characteristics of green and blue space is a much \nbroader issue than that of the level of biodiversity of such spaces, alone. \nBased on the above, the EEWG assumes that, since both type and characteristics of green and blue \nspace, as well as mental health and well-being are broad ranging concepts, that may necessitate a \n wide search to begin with (many different search terms), with relatively few of the initially identified \narticles satisfying inclusion criteria upon closer inspection. \nIt is especially with regard to the initial stages of the full SR that additional funding by WHO is needed \n to be able to perform a SR. A meta-analysis will be conducted, but only if both the studies satisfying \n the inclusion criteria for the SR and the available resources allow the EEWG to do so.","The Russian Far East (RFE) is an important hotspot of biodiversity whose insect fauna remains understudied, particularly its Microlepidoptera. Here we explore the diversity of leaf-mining micromoths of the family Gracillariidae, their distribution and host plant associations in RFE using a combination of field observations and sampling, DNA barcoding, morphological analysis and literature review.                We collected 91 gracillariid specimens (45 larvae, 9 pupae and 37 adults) in 12 localities across RFE and identified 34 species using a combination of DNA barcoding and morphology. We provide a genetic library of 57 DNA barcodes belonging to 37 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), including four BINs that could potentially represent species new to science. Leaf mines and leaf shelters are described and illustrated for 32 studied species, male or female genitalia as well as forewing patterns of adults are shown, especially for those species identified based on morphology.                Three species, Micrurapteryx caraganella (Hering), Callisto insperatella (Nickerl), and Phyllonorycter junoniella (Zeller) are newly recorded from RFE. Five species previously known from some regions of RFE, were found for the first time in Amurskaya Oblast: Phyllonorycter populifoliella (Treitschke), Primorskii Krai: Ph. sorbicola Kumata and Sahkalin Island: Caloptilia heringi Kumata, Ph. ermani (Kumata) and Ph. ulmifoliella (Hübner). Eight gracillariid-plant associations are novel to science: Caloptilia gloriosa Kumata on Acer pseudosieboldianum, Cameraria niphonica Kumata on A. caudatum subsp. ukurundense, Parornix ermolaevi Kuznetzov on Corylus sieboldiana, Phyllonorycter ermani (Kumata) on Betula platyphylla, Ph. nipponicella (Issiki) on Quercus mongolica, Ph. orientalis (Kumata) and Ph. pseudojezoniella Noreika on Acer saccharum, Ph. sorbicola on Prunus maakii. For the first time we documented the \"green island\" phenotype on Phyllonorycter cavella (Zeller) mines on Betula platyphylla.                Two pestiferous species have been recorded during our surveys: Micrurapteryx caraganella on ornamental Caragana arborescens in urban plantations in Amurskaya Oblast, and the lime leafminer Phyllonorycter issikii (Kumata), a species known to be native to RFE and invasive elsewhere in Russia and in European countries.                A revised checklist of RFE gracillariids has been compiled. It accounts for 135 species among which 17 species (13%) are only known to occur in RFE. The gracillariid fauna of RFE is more similar to the Japanese fauna (49%), than to the fauna of the rest of Russia (i.e European part and Siberia) (32%).","The evolution in the mangrove forest wetland landscape and its drive forces within Qi’Ao island where is in the Pearl River Estuary were analyzed. The integrative methods including literatures researching, three temporal phrases (1988, 1995,2002) remote sensing images data were analyzed and field survey were adopted in this paper. By literatures researches, three main evolution stages, including silt tidal flats, mangrove forest tidal flats, mangrove forest plain, were undergone. By remote sensing data in 1988, 1995 and 2002 to be as basic information resource and with the support of GIS, the dynamic development of mangrove forest wetland landscape pattern was analyzed. Currently, about 200 hm 2 of mangroves are present in Qi’Ao island in 2004. These mangroves are important ecosystems, but are subject to disturbance from a number of sources. In recent 25 years, there has been a loss of more than 77 hm 2, as a result of natural losses and mangrove clearing (e.g. for urban and industrial development, agriculture and aquaculture). However, areas of new mangroves have been established by mangrove introduction and afforestation especially since 1999. These new mangroves have mainly appeared in the Dawei bay of Qi’Ao islands. The results showed that the spatial patterns and species composition of mangrove patches have been changed. The biodiversity of mangrove forest species has obviously been declined, the dominant mangrove species is Sonneratia apetala . In addition, mangrove forest wetland vegetation biomass was calculated by field survey. Based on the synthesis analysis, according to the view of ecosystem management, four countermeasures for regulating and controlling, which aim to construct mangrove forest ecological sequence and the biodiversit of mangrove forest wetland vegetation, were put forward: 1) to construct the typical succession model by dealing with the relations between the vegetation biodiversity and competition; 2) to strengthen the environmental policy research for Qi’Ao islands mangrove forest wetland; 3) to build up an early warning system for considering ecosystem vulnerability of mangroves; 4) to develop ecotourism by planning Qi’ao islands mangrove forest wetland park scientifically.","In the present study, chemically and biologically enhanced phytoremediation potentials of maize (Zea mays) and mustard (Brassica campestris) were evaluated by cropping them on two different metals contaminated soils of Lahore and Gujranwala for 75 days. Soils were treated with varying amounts of DTPA (Diethylene Triamine Penta Acetic acid) and three different fungal species to facilitate metal uptake by plants. In pot experiment under green house, addition of fungi and DTPA chelate significantly increased the Cu, Pb, Cr and Cd concentrations in roots and shoots. Maximum maize shoot biomass was obtained in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus and maximum root biomass was produced in the presence of Aspergillus niger. In case of mustard crop both shoot and root biomass was maximum produced in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus. It was found that maximum Cd and Cu were solubilized in Aspergillus flavus inoculated soils while Pb and Cr were solubilized maximum in Aspergillus fumigatus inoculated soils in case of maize experiment. In case of mustard maximum Cd and Cu were solubilized in Aspergillus niger inoculated soils while Pb and Cr were solubilized maximum in Aspergillus flavus inoculated soils. Increased metals uptake, bioconcentration factor, and phytoextraction rate and phytoextraction efficiency were noticed over the control in both fungal and DTPA amended soils. Based on obtained data a phytoremdiation model was developed. *CorrespondingAuthor:Shazia Akhtarshazoo_786@yahoo.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 8, No. 4, p. 158-171, 2016 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 159 | Akhtar and Iram Introduction A variety of treatment technologies has been developed for the remediation of metals contaminated soils and phytoextraction is an economically feasible technique. It is publically more acceptable and also has potential to clean the environment (Chen and Cutright, 2002). Phytoremediation is a plant based remediation strategy which uses the plants for the environmental remediation (Rauf et al., 2009). Many chemical and biological treatments, such as inoculums of fungi and bacteria, EDTA, DTPA, NTA and other organic compound have been reported to used in pot and field experiments to facilitate the heavy metals extraction and to acquire the higher efficiency of phytoextraction/phytoremediation (Blaylock et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1997; Kayser etal., 2000; Ke et al., 2006 and Wu et al., 2006). It is known that microbial populations affect the solubilization of heavy metals and their availability to plants, through acidification, releasing chelator and reduction-oxidation changes (Peer et. al., 2006). It is reported that presence of microbes in the rhizosphere increases the levels of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cd in plants. Heavy metals tolerance and production of biomass could be enhanced by improved interaction among the plants and rhizosphere microbes. So it is considered an important phytoremediation technology factor (Whiting et. al., 2003). Fungi play a very important role in solubilization and fixation of heavy metal ions and change the availability of these ions for the plants (Birch and Bachofen 1990). Different soil and plant factors affect the phytoremediation process and these also include the soil fungi. There is a need of information about symbiotic relationships between soil microbes (bacteria and fungi) and roots of plants. Heavy metals are also in compound forms in soil which also affects the metals behavior in their solubilization and uptake processes (Boruvka and Drabek, 2004). Different types of components present in the fungal cell walls like carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino and other functional groups. Through these functional groups fungi can bind with toxic heavy metals such as Pb, Cu, Cd and Ni etc. (Kapoor and Viraraghavan, 1995). The phytoremediation effectiveness limited often because of low solubility of metals and theirsorption on surfaces of soil particals, however metals solubilization could be increased by adding complexing/chelating agents with the time (Pivetz, 2001). In the literature several chelating agents has been reported which enhance the rate of phytoextraction. However EDTA and DTPA has been investigated widely and they have high chelating ability towards the most of the metals, like Cd, Cu, Cr and Pb, which ultimately leads to increased translocation of metals from soil to plant (Barlow et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2004 and Begonia et al., 2005). A lot of researches on phytoextraction are based on green house experiments few tested the hyperaccomulators plants in the field and actually determined their heavy metals accumulation potential (Hammer and Keller, 2003; McGrath et al., 2006 and Zhuang et al., 2007). Pakistan is a developing country and its population is more as compared to resources. Most of the area is used for agriculture and urbanization purpose. Due to industrialization the increase level of contamination is making land useless for better yield production. Contamination of lands with toxic heavy metals is a widespread environmental issue. The present study was planned by keeping in view the heavy metals exposure directly to the water and agriculture soils. The proposed study was done in laboratory and under green house conditions with the objectives to evaluate the efficacy of a synthetic chelator and isolated fungi in the uptake and translocation of heavy metals as well as on the total biomass of plants. Materials and methods Soil sampling Bulk surface samples of two soils used for arable agriculture were collected from Gujranwala and Lahore. These soils were polluted with heavy metals. Soil from Gujranwala(fine–loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Udic Haplustalf) were collected from peri-urban areas of Gujranwala (N 32°–06.262; E J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 160 | Akhtar and Iram 74°–10.236) and Lahore (N 24°–57.212; E 69°– 17.329). Soil preparation Contaminated soil samples were dried in open air, grinded and sieved through a stainless steel sieve of 2-mm. About 200 g portion of soil was again sieved from the &lt;2-mm sieved and reground to obtain a &lt;200-μm fraction of soil for chemical analysis. The Gujranwala surface soil was medium in texture with higher soil percentage organic matter content. Both soils are calcareous in nature. Total heavy metal concentrations in the soils were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy with graphite furnace of PerkinElmer AAnalyser 800 model. Green house pot experiment Three kgof each of the contaminated Gujranwala and Lahore soils werefilled in polyethylene lined plastic pots, after that six seedsof each crop were sownin each pot. The soils were fertilized with500mg N kg−1 of dry soil as urea (in three splits),50 mg K kg−1 as KH2PO4. 2H2Oand 70 mg P kg−1 as a basal dose. The pots were brought to near60 % of the water holding capacity by the addition of distilledwater and after that were maintained around this moisture levelthroughout the whole experiment. Chelating agent (DTPA) was applied at the rate of 0,1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mM kg−1 of soil in two equal splits at 25th and 45th day after sowing in triplicate. Fifteen ml spores suspension of three fungal species Aspergillus niger (Specie A), Aspergillus flavus (Specie B) and Aspergillus fumigatuse (Species C) were applied in triplicates. Applied fungal cultures were two weeks old. Each fungal inoculated pot was also amended with 100 mL potato broth of 107strength at the time of sowing. Plantswere harvested after 75 day of sowing, and shoots and roots were washed with simple and deionized water. Fresh and dry weights (after drying at40 °C) of shoots and roots were recorded periodically and analyzed for Cr, Cu, Cd and Pb. After harvesting, the soil was analyzed for DTPA extractable Cd, Pb, Cu and Cr concentrations. Analysis of data In order to compare the phytoextraction efficiency of all the plant species after the addition of different chelating material concentrations to soils, the Bioconcentration Factor (BCF), Phytoextraction Rate (PR) and extraction factor (EF) were calculated. A phytoremediation model was developed based on generated data and time period for the reclamation of metals contaminated soils was predicted using obtained information. Results and discussion Maize shoot biomass Inoculation with Aspergillus niger showed 13.8% increase in maize shoot biomass, Aspergillus flavus showed 11.5% and Aspergillus fumigatus showed 18.6% increased in fresh shoot biomass as compared to control (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Maize shoot fresh biomass production in Gujranwala and Lahore soils in the presence of fungi and DTPA concentrations. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 161 | Akhtar and Iram It was also shown in the graphical presentation that experiment conducted under green house using Lahore contaminated soil 6.7% and 4.1 % decrease in maize shoot fresh weight was observed when Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were applied respectively but 18% increased was noticed in case of Aspergillus fumigatus innoculation.Overall Aspergillus fumigatus presented good results in plant grown in both Lahore and Gujranwala soils. In case of chemical treatment, DTPA amendment showed less shoot biomass growth as compared to the control in Lahore and Gujranwala soils only DTPA dose 1.25 mM kg-1 showed 14.2% more growth as compared to control in Gujranwala soil. Exactly same trend was notices in dry biomasses of maize shoot (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Maize shoot dry biomass production in Gujranwala and Lahore soils in the presence of fungi and DTPA concentrations. Fig. 3. Maize root fresh biomass production in Gujranwala and Lahore soils in the presence of fungi and DTPA concentrations. Maize root biomass With the addition of spore suspension of fungal strains growth was affected significantly and plants inoculated with Aspergillus niger showed 22.7% increase in root biomass as compared to control in Gujranwala soil and similarly plants ","This research purposed to find the concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) pollutants in coastal sediment, Semarang, to find relationship between the heavy metal concentration and external environment based on the result of test that will be obtained from costal sediments samples, to make recomendation about pollution and change that occurs on the state of the environment in the urban catchment, creating databae on pollution control in the region and in the future to maintain biodiversity (to give the industrial activities-pollution permits-by official bodies for the protection of the environment in the state). \nThis research will be conducted in 2017 with the location of sampling and water quality measurement conducted at Usman Janatin Street, Semarang. The sample analysis will be conducted at the Diponegoro University Integrated Laboratory. \nBased on the result and analysis, the conclusion in this research as follows: (1)There is relationship between levels of heavy metals and external environment. The relationship is positive, it means the higher levels of heavy metals, the external environment will be more polluted. The lower levels of heavy metals, the external environment will be low polluted. (2) The internal levels of coastal sediment can be used as an index to infer the state of the environment. (3) This heavy metals determination tool can be used to support policy and decision-making.","Our research project was designed to analyze the inter-play between aging, chronic lung injury, lung microbiome and exposure to air pollutants. The project was divided into four parts: \n1) systematic review of the literature about the role of non-invasive biomarkers in detecting the acute respiratory effects of traffic-related air pollution; \n2) retrospective/prospective study of the possible predictors of carbon particles accumulation in the airways macrophages; \n3) prospective evaluation of the effect of smoking and/or disease (COPD) on microbial colonization of the lung; \n4) prospective study about the effects of traffic-related air pollution and cigarette smoke on lung aging. \nThe first part was a systematic review of the literature on the use of samples obtained in a non-invasive way aimed to study the short-term effects of urban traffic-related air pollution on the respiratory system. Although subjects with COPD have been generally considered to be at higher risk for the adverse effects of air pollutants, these patients have been recruited only in a few studies [1-4]. According Manney et al. [1], an increase of nitrates and nitrites in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is associated with a large exposure to particles in subjects with COPD and asthma, with no differences between the two diseases. FeNO measurements yielded conflicting results: one study found a association with PM2.5 in subjects with COPD, but not with asthma [2], while in another study [3], FeNO levels resulted to be associated with PM pollution in participants with asthma but not in those with COPD. According to Gong et al. [4] cellularity of induced sputum in COPD patients is not affected by particles exposure. More research is thus required to clarify the effect of air pollution related to acute traffic in people who suffer from lung diseases other than asthma. The acute effects on respiratory disease are difficult to be attributed to a particular pollutant in most surveys with environmental exposure [5]. Further research are warranted to promote a better standardization of methods for pollutants monitoring. In real life conditions, 'unexposed' subjects do not exist and the difference between the minimum and maximum levels of air pollution is often less than three times [6]. When planning observational studies, a baseline for levels of inflammatory markers in individuals exposed to low levels of pollutants should be established to be able to detect an effect at higher exposures. \nThe second part of our project aimed to investigate the determinants of the accumulation of carbon particles in the cytoplasm of airway macrophages obtained from induced sputum. Three groups of subjects were enrolled: patients suffering from COPD, healthy smokers and non-smoking healthy controls. Exposure to cigarette smoke, to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and occupational exposure was quantified with a dedicated questionnaire. This analysis aimed to control potential confounders to make a correct evaluation of the personal exposure to air pollution. The most important predictors of the black carbon (BC) load in airway macrophages resulted to be the presence of COPD and urban traffic exposure, while smoking did not show any significant association. Traffic exposure in the previous year of the visit (measured as the number of equivalent vehicles) was correlated with the carbon load. In addition, in COPD the carbon particles accumulation did not resulted to be correlated with the degree of obstruction nor with the degree of neutrophilic inflammation of the airways. In conclusion , quantification of BC in macrophages is suitable for assessing traffic exposure, although further studies are needed to assess macrophage function in patients with and without disease and to evaluate the biological effects of the individual carbon load. The third part aimed to non-invasively assess the differential role of cigarette smoke and smoke-associated chronic airflow limitation on airways bacterial colonization. The molecular identification of the pulmonary microbiota in three groups of subjects was carried out. Phyla and genera present in each subject and in each group were identified. It was then calculated α and β diversity index to evaluate the differences in bacterial composition intra sample and between samples of the same group, respectively. The composition of phyla in stable COPD patients was similar to that found in earlier research based on the use of bronchial brushing and bronchoalveolar lavage with the advantage that our number of sequence reading was much higher than those previously analyzed. It was also observed that subjects with COPD who received corticosteroids showed a lower abundance of bacteria of genus Prevotella and greater abundance of Veillonella genus compared to untreated subjects. Smokers have an increased relative number of Neisseria and Bergeyella genera, and a decreased relative number of Streptococcus and Rothia genera compared to non-smokers. Our results suggested that cigarette smoking may cause a decrease in the relative abundance of species, regardless of the development of chronic airflow limitation, thus influencing the composition of the lung microbiome. Molecular analysis proved to be indispensable to compare different niches and to identify the most abundant organisms present in different groups. Indeed, traditional culture tests and biochemical assays did not allows phenotypic identification of bacteria. The analysis of the resident microbiota in patients with stable COPD compared to smokers and non-smokers suggested the richness of the microbiota is important for lung health. \nIn the fourth part of the research a feasibility study of DNA extraction from sputum cells and the respective quantification was performed. The evaluation of lung aging due to urban pollution and cigarette smoke was carried out on both samples of blood and induced sputum and the telomere length will be measured. We expected that the rate of decline in lung function would be associated with the rate of biological aging. We also assumed that aging in white blood cells reflects that of cells coming from induced sputum. We expected that cigarette smoking accelerates the aging of cells in induced sputum when inflammation and exposure to environmental pollution are constant. \nIn conclusion, the presence of COPD affects both the lung carbon load linked to urban traffic (with the same external exposure of the subjects), and the biodiversity of lung microbial colonization. On the other hand, cigarette smoking has no effect on the content of carbon particles, but acts on the composition of the microbiota.","In order to develop ecological farming, China has established a unified basic pension insurance system for urban and rural farmers. Ecological farming is a pioneering, practical development which aims to create globally sustainable land management systems, and encourages review of the importance of maintaining biodiversity in food production and farming end products. This article takes Hangzhou as an example, to study the guarantee extent of the implementation of the basic pension insurance system on the objective security of rural residents’ life. This paper also studies the subjective perception of rural residents’ well-being, urban and rural integration and social fairness under the existing rural basic old-age insurance policy. A switch to ecological farming will benefit health and environment. The results show that the rural endowment insurance is not enough to meet the needs of life and the satisfaction of the endowment insurance policy and has a significant impact on rural residents’ sense of happiness and social justice. The article reveals the possible shortcomings of the industrial agriculture and current basic old-age insurance in rural areas, thus providing a reference for the government to formulate an integrated urban and rural endowment insurance system.","Abstract This paper reports the first survey of coverage of resource and environment issues in the Vietnamese press. It provides a snapshot of current attention to environmental problems and a baseline against which to measure future change. A systematic content analysis is made of the national daily Nhan Dan, the most influential newspaper in the country. Thirty out of a total of 210 articles were selected at random for intensive review. Topics covered include agriculture, biodiversity conservation, environmental education, environmental protection, environmental risks, forestry, urbanization, and the urban environment. The level of attention given to the environment in Vietnam's press appears to be less than in a comparable study of Malaysia from the 1970s. Furthermore, although Vietnamese journalists tried their best in the reporting of environmental topics, most articles were handicapped by low intelligibility and lack of scientific accuracy. Although many scientists believe that public concern with e...","Tree-ring research has made significant contributions to our understanding of environmental change and forest stand dynamics. Its application to understanding natural history, however, has been limited. Biodiversity of the central hardwood forest offers many opportunities for tree-ring based, natural history research. Recent tree-ring research examining several rarely studied hardwood species has yielded ages well beyond maximum expectations. For example, a sampling of 20 Magnolia acuminata trees in one population included two individuals 315 and 348 years, respectively, which are nearly two centuries more than the average life expectancy reported for this species. Also, research in recently discovered old-growth stands in western Massachusetts has illustrated the common occurrence of Betula lenta in Tsuga canadensis dominated oldgrowth forests with individuals frequently living beyond 320 years in these systems. These studies illustrate that tree-ring research can expand our knowledge of the natural history of central hardwood species. iNtroDuctioN The science of dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) has enhanced our understanding of environmental change, succession, and forest stand dynamics. In the eastern U.S., this type of research has been substantial and rich (i.e., Lorimer 1980, Foster 1988, Canham 1990, Runkle 1990, Stahle and Chaney 1994, Nowacki and Abrams 1997, Orwig and others 2001, Shumway and others 2001, Lafon and Speer 2002). In recent years, however, dendrochronology has been less frequently applied towards the understanding of natural history (cf. Dayton 2003). This type of natural history information may be more important now than ever before (Dayton, 2003; Schmidly 2005) as species and ecosystems are threatened by invasive species, land-use (development/urban sprawl), forest fragmentation and future climate change. The term ‘natural history’, unfortunately, is a rather nebulous term (Schmidly, 2005). In this paper we will focus on the application of dendrochronology towards determining a species’ longevity and its persistence in the forest. We posit the idea, however, that dendrochronology can reveal many aspects of a species’ lifehistory traits, which is an important part of its natural history. Tree-ring studies in old-growth forests are valuable sources of information regarding the natural history of central hardwood species (cf. Rentch and others 2003a,b), as well as the natural disturbance dynamics, and development patterns for forest types throughout the region. This paper will highlight specific examples of new information concerning the natural history of four species. This information is derived from two recent dendrochronological studies in old-growth forests (Pederson 2005, D’Amato and others in review). The purpose of these studies was to identify the climatic sensitivity and growth history of several species in the eastern U.S. (Pederson 2005) and to estimate the amount of old-growth forest in Massachusetts (D’Amato and others in review). And yet, the ease at which new maximum ages were found highlights the fact that there are significant gaps in the natural history of many species characteristics of the central hardwood forest. Our hope is that this paper will stimulate additional research that will enrich our knowledge for many eastern U.S. species. The first portion of this paper will focus on the longevity of four rarely studied temperate hardwood species: black birch (Betula lenta L.), cucumbertree (Magnolia acuminata L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch). New data and a review of maximum ages found 1 Neil Pederson, Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Moore 235, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, KY 40475; Anthony W.

We hypothesized that the main driver of the phyllosphere microbiome might be the season and that atmospheric pollutants might have a co-effect. Hence, we investigated the composition of epiphytic bacteria and fungi of leaves sampled in urban and natural areas (in Southern Italy) in summer and winter, using microscopy and metagenomic analysis. To assess possible co-effects on the composition of the phyllosphere microbiome, concentrations of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined from sampled leaves. We found that environmental factors had a significative influence on the phyllosphere biodiversity, altering the taxa relative abundances. Ascomycota and Firmicutes were higher in summer and in urban areas, whereas a significant increase in Proteobacteria was observed in the winter season, with higher abundance in natural areas. Network analysis suggested that OTUs belonging to Acidobacteria, Cytophagia, unkn. Firmicutes(p), Actinobacteria are keystone of the Q. ilex phyllosphere microbiome. In addition, 83 genes coding for 5 enzymes involved in PAH degradation pathways were identified. Given that the phyllosphere microbiome can be considered an extension of the ecosystem services offered by trees, our results can be exploited in the framework of Next-Generation Biomonitoring.","Iraqs Mesopotamian marshes were once the largest wetlands in southwest Asia and covered &gt; 15,000 square kilometers (km) during spring floods, an area nearly twice the size of the original Everglades. Pulsed water events from spring snow melt in the mountains of Turkey, Iran, and Syria were the driving force that supported the vast expanse of marshes with annual inputs of water and sediment. The marshes were once famous for their biodiversity and cultural richness and originally the permanent habitat for millions of birds and a flyway for millions more migrating between Siberia and Africa. However, by the year 2000 less than 10% of the area remained as functioning marshes due to a systematic plan by the Iraqi government to ditch, dike and drain the marshes. Pulsed water conditions that historically developed and sustained the marshes in Iraq are now controlled by a series of internal dams and external water reallocations in Turkey, Syria and Iran. Recent data on water budgets and an USACE HECResSim model for Iraq water resources suggest a significant loss of water upstream for urban, agricultural and reservoir needs. This coupled with projected Iranian, Turkey and Syrian water resources demands suggests a much reduced area of restored marshes in the future. However, during recent high snow melt years more than 55% of the original marsh had been reflooded or was covered by marsh vegetation according to UNEP satellite analysis as of December 2008. However, re-flooding alone does not equate to restoration since water is often found to be saline and water flow is restricted by extensive dikes, further increasing salinity. However, when proper hydrologic and water quality conditions are restored marsh vegetation recovery is rapid. Recent studies have shown that three years after re-flooding plant community structure and productivity have increased to near historic levels and changes in ecological diversity for key trophic levels in the marshes are also restored. For example, overall recovery of ecosystem functions (plant productivity, hydrodynamics etc) reached nearly 50% of historic values for three restored marsh areas by 2006, only 3 years after reflooding. Seventy-four bird species were found by 2006, but total numbers were considerably lower than historic records. Unfortunately, the national and international demands for water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers for agriculture and urban demands along with a current drought severely threaten the future water supplies for the marshes and in turn the continued restoration of the plant and animal communities of the marshes. The present water demands, water quality and regional needs, which may alter the future of the marshes, are analyzed.","\n Establishing forest connection in landscapes under urban sprawl is essential for maintaining the ecological processes and ensuring biodiversity conservation. However, the major challenge is incorporated the ecological network in the land-use/land-cover planning. This way, the main objective of the study was the evaluation of environmental criteria for prioritizing areas to obtain forest functional connectivity in a landscape subject to the urban sprawl. The second objective was to understand how the criteria are associated with the structural forest attributes represented by traditional landscape ecology metrics. The criteria were defined through the literature review, representing the landscape characteristics as the topographic, conflicts, and biotics. The metrics used to characterize the forest structure were perimeter, shape index, and distance to the nearest neighbor. They were generated to a selected group of forest remnants, which represent the landscape forest structure. Sampling the criteria and forest fragments maps (i.e., different maps representing the metrics-values) through the hexagon network, we assessed how the criteria are associated with the structural forest attributes. The statistical analysis used to evaluate these sampled values were The Moran Global (Moran I) and Moran Local (LISA). We obtained that the urban expansion process is diffuse, although it does not occur randomly in our landscape. The criteria slope, TWI, distance from drainage network, distance from highways, distance from the low-density urban area, and distance from forest patches have characteristics that support this process. Furthermore, our results indicated a spatial autocorrelation among metrics and after, among metrics and these criteria. Also, we obtained that the external influences on the fragments did not occur randomly and that the criteria act on the landscape. This way, through these criteria, we can identify regions where it is possible to have the persistence of forest fragments, even though in places under the impact of urban sprawl.","Rapid Increase of building stocks in the world today has created a significant negative impact to the natural environment. Construction of buildings and other civil engineering structures consumes the natural environment and contribute for the pollution in a considerable amount. In Sri Lankan context also this issue is developing gradually specially in urban areas and with the development of new cities. Designing the buildings to reduce the environmental impact by integrating different ecofriendly initiatives has been identified as a solution to mitigate the environmental impact of rapid urbanization. Vertical greenery can be identified as such ecofriendly initiative and it is worthwhile to study about the applicability of the concept. Therefore, study focuses on exploring enablers and barriers of vertical greenery in Sri Lankan context. A comprehensive literature review was carried out to explore the importance of the research area. Eventually, a set of enablers and barriers were identified for vertical greenery in Sri Lanka. A quantitative approach was adopted whereby thirty one questionnaires were distributed among property owners, facilities managers, architects, landscape designers, operational managers, constructors and members representing government body regarding vertical greenery in Sri Lanka. Collected data of the questionnaire survey was analyzed using one sample t-test in SPSS statistical software packages and Relative Importance Index (RII) technique to identify most significant enablers and most critical barriers of vertical greenery. Accordingly, the total number of ten enablers and total number of eleven barriers were identified. According to the analysis most significant enablers of vertical greenery have been identified as restoring the biodiversity into urban building and vertical greenery helps to reduce carbon dioxide while increasing oxygen to the environment. Further, lack of awareness of the benefits and performance of vertical greenery systems and lack of information on plants that will perform well on vertical facades in Sri Lanka have been identified as most critical barriers of vertical greenery.","Rapid urbanization rates impact significantly on the nature of Land Cover patterns of the environment, which has been evident in the depletion of vegetal reserves and in general modifying the human climatic systems (Henderson, et al., 2017; Kumar, Masago, Mishra, &amp; Fukushi, 2018; Luo and Lau, 2017). This study explores remote sensing classification technique and other auxiliary data to determine LULCC for a period of 50 years (1967-2016). The LULCC types identified were quantitatively evaluated using the change detection approach from results of maximum likelihood classification algorithm in GIS. Accuracy assessment results were evaluated and found to be between 56 to 98 percent of the LULC classification. The change detection analysis revealed change in the LULC types in Minna from 1976 to 2016. Built-up area increases from 74.82ha in 1976 to 116.58ha in 2016. Farmlands increased from 2.23 ha to 46.45ha and bared surface increases from 120.00ha to 161.31ha between 1976 to 2016 resulting to decline in vegetation, water body, and wetlands. The Decade of rapid urbanization was found to coincide with the period of increased Public Private Partnership Agreement (PPPA). Increase in farmlands was due to the adoption of urban agriculture which has influence on food security and the environmental sustainability. The observed increase in built up areas, farmlands and bare surfaces has substantially led to reduction in vegetation and water bodies. The oscillatory nature of water bodies LULCC which was not particularly consistent with the rates of urbanization also suggests that beyond the urbanization process, other factors may influence the LULCC of water bodies in urban settlements. \nKeywords: Minna, Niger State, Remote Sensing, Land Surface Characteristics \n  \nReferences \nAkinrinmade, A., Ibrahim, K., &amp; Abdurrahman, A.

These ex‐mining sites are low in biodiversity with poor natural succession. Especially, isolated patches of tin tailings trapped in agricultural and urban developments have virtually very little natural regeneration. Hence artificial regeneration needs to be carried out. Successful tree planting techniques developed for greening sand tailings have been recorded. Yet, there is a lack of scientific data to support the soil amendment treatments recommended. This study was embarked with the aims to determine the effects of soil enrichment on survival and growth of Acacia mangium × Acacia auriculiformis (Acacia hybrid), Swietenia macrophylla (mahogany) and Khaya ivorensis (khaya). The study plots were established as a 3x4 factorial combination of soil amendments, fertilizer treatments and tree species in a completely randomized design. Fertilizer treatments including control, 120 g chicken manure point-1 at six‐month interval and 120 kg empty fruit bunch (EFB) point-1. The soil amendments assessed were control and application of 60 kg of mineral soil point-1. The seedlings were planted at 3x3 m spacing. Weeding and fertilization were carried out at three months interval. Soils were systematically and properly sampled for chemical analysis. The data of survival, vegetative growth, biomass and physiological responds of the three species were collected for analysis. Net photosynthesis and transpiration with leaf temperature of timber species were measured using a portable H2O/CO2 analyzer and LICOR super porometer, respectively. All the data collected were statistically analysed. The results show that Acacia hybrid had the highest survival, vegetative growth and biomass among the three species. The significantly greater survival, growth and high biomass accumulation of Acacia hybrid is due to its high adaptability by producing abundant leaves that enlarges the photosynthetically‐active leaf area. In addition, this study shows that at optimum temperature, the net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration of Acacia hybrid were significantly greater than khaya and mahogany. This study also shows that soil treatment increased the growth of the three timber species on sand tailings. Chicken manure is a better type of fertilizer than EFB for timber species grown on sand tailings. Acacia hybrid treated with soil plus EFB or chicken manure had significantly the highest growth rates resulted in greatest biomass. Khaya ivorensis requires site preparation using soil plus chicken manure or EFB. Swietenia macrophylla treated with chicken manure or soil plus chicken manure grew better than other treatments. This study shows that the right species choice with viable site preparation technique and treated with suitable organic fertilizer are crucial to ensure the success of growing the timber species on impoverished ex‐mining sites.","Fear of crime is an important social problem which has the negative impact on sociability and quality of life. The isolated streets are defined as urban spaces where fear of crime is highly perceived. Feeling safe depends on the knowledge about the environment which needs the awareness of where you are in the space. Thus, it is considered that spatial knowledge is crucial to evaluate feeling of safety. This study aims to investigate the relationship between fear of crime and space configuration in Mixed-use neighbourhood. The study focused on accessibility measures based on the axial line street model in order to define safe spaces and fearsome in urban street space. The main method and procedures used include: space syntax method to analyze space configuration characteristics of the study areas and questionnaire to examine the fearsome and safe places. Axial analysis, as the analytical tool, is applied to provide the opportunity for exploration of accessibility patterns of a space network. Furthermore, integration value, level of connectivity, and choice level as the accessibility measures are calculated by Depthmap software. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed to investigate the relationship between syntactical variables and safe and fearsome place. Taman Universiti neighbourhood in Malaysia is chosen as the case study. The findings show that to have a safe walkable space is essential to consider integration values, connectivity and choice value in planni ng and designing the urban street networks. *Corresponding Author: Sara Jaberolansar  sara.jaberolansar@gmail.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 11, No. 5, p. 161-168, 2017 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 162 | Mahdzar et al. Introduction Crime and fear of becoming a victim have always been the major concerns for the general public in the world. In fact, achieving the sustainability could be faced with the significant challenges in presence of crime and fear of crime, because an “unsustainable city” is generally determined by: “images of poverty, physical deterioration, increasing levels of crime, and perceived fear of crime” (Cozen, 2002). Crime has various types such as theft assault, robbery, burglary, street violence and many more. It relates to a specified material or situation, while fear of crime depends on the feeling or perception of the environment. Fear of crime is defined as a response to the properties of the space and is more general than the crime itself (Hutchings, 1994). One of the most significant social problems is fear of crime, which affects the quality of life and destroys the social relations (Hedayati Marzbali et al., 2012, Torstensson Levander, 2007 and Zedner, 2009, Savina et al., 2013). Previous research findings have shown that fear of crime has a negative impact on walking in public spaces (Sallis and Kerr, 2006), and it is one of the important factors in reducing the amount of walking among the people (Ellaway et al., 2005). On the other hand, designing walkable cities is an important facet in creating a low-carbon society (Low Carbon Society Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, 2025). Therefore, reducing the fear of crime could enhance walking in cities and consequently, lead to sustainability. Although, the relationship between crime and space has been investigated in numerous studies and their results shown that crime occurrence is related to the spatial configurations of the space, but the correlation between fear of crime and space needs more verifications. According to the Lang (1994) “Feeling safe depends on the knowledge of the environment which needs the awareness of where you are in the space and time”. Therefore, spatial knowledge is essential to evaluate feeling of safety. This paper reports on an ongoing study that examines the relationship between the fear of crime and spatial configuration in mixed land use neighbourhood. It investigates how space syntax analysis of the neighbourhood spatial configuration is related to the fear of crime. It leads to find the characteristics of vulnerable spaces in a certain neighbourhood. This study attempts to propose a street network structure for the safe walkable urban space. Materials and methods Space Syntax Methodology Space syntax is a particular analytical methodology, which was developed, by Hillier and Hanson (1984) with their team of researchers at University College London that applies mathematical techniques and attaches quantitative values to the relationships of spaces from the macro to the micro scale for urban environmental design. Space syntax is a language used for describing urban space. Based on the theoretical background of space syntax method, this technique explains the relationship between spatial environments and users’ behaviors. Thus, it is thought to be the adequate approached for the goal of this study. Analytical Tool: Axial Map of Analysis However, axial line application is a technique which is used to compute a set of measurements of syntactical characteristics of space. Axial lines refer to the longest visibility lines (the longest collections of lines of view) that pass via all open spaces in a studied region (Kim and Penn, 2004). According to the literature review about this technique, it is figured out that axial line can be regarded as, from the view of how human perceive space, a unit space “vista space” (Jiang et al., 2000). Based on the fundamental idea in space syntax, through the analysis of how these unit spaces are connected or integrated to each other; the spatial structure of the urban space can be understood and human social activities among the space can be predicted (Hillier and Hanson, 1984; Mahdzar, 2008). J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 163 | Mahdzar et al. Accessibility measures which reflect the characteristics of urban spaces is required to find the relevance among the urban configuration and pedestrian fear of crime. Accessibility measures include connectivity, global integration, local integration and choice. Case Study Taman Universiti neighborhood, a mixed land use neighbourhood is chosen as a case study. It is a university town near Johor Bahru City in Malaysia (see figure 1 and 2). The most important component of this neighborhood is the design of commercial streets to support the activities, functions by the people who work or live there (Jacobs, 1961). This area has different land uses with various activities, which allows the research to evaluate pedestrian fear of crime that they might be facing in the area. Measures and Procedure Depthmap software is applied to analyze the spatial configuration, ie the spatial structure of the neighbourhood. Through preparing the axial model of neighbourhood, this study examines space syntax measures such as integration values (global and local), levels of connectivity between spaces, and choice. These measures calculated in Depthmap are based on the shortest-path, from a topological perspective, between two axial lines on the map. Questionnaires in a form of the map of the neighbourhood area were applied in order to examine which places are fearsome or safe. Participants were asked to define the safe and fearsome places to walk within the neighbourhood map provided. The results have been applied to the neighbourhood plan with green point for safe places and red one defining fearsome places to walk (Figure 7 and 8). A spectral color from red to blue is used for visualization where the blue color shows the lowest value, and the red color represents the highest value. The integration measure of an axial line (Figure3 and 4) is defined as the reciprocal of the sum of the least path from the root axial line to all others; the connectivity (Figure 5) refers to the number of the lines directly connected with the given line; the choice measure (Figure 6) is defined as the number of shortest-paths, which contain the root axial line dividing the number of all shortest-paths (Hillier and Iida, 2005). Result Correlation between Questionnaire Results and Accessibility Measures Correlations between axial line measures and questionnaire outcome are calculated for finding the relationship between spatial configuration and pedestrian fear of crime. Table 1. Correlation between accessibility measures and questionnaire results (Green point). Green point on the questionnary result R R square P-value Global integration value 0.702*** 0.493 0.0000 Local inegartion value 0.648*** 0.420 0.0000 Level of Connectivity 0.795*** 0.633 0.0000 Choice value 0.890*** 0.792 0.0000 *** = p&lt; 0.001, ** = p&lt; 0.010, * = p&lt; 0.050. The results are used to identify which variables of urban configuration effect on fear of crime. At the end, a model is proposed for walkable urban space. The relationship between choice value and safe space of urban street (green point on the questionnaires) shows a highly significant coefficient of correlation (r=0.890, p &lt; 0.001) in comparison with other accessibility measures. Level of connectivity (r= 0.795, p &lt; 0.001) reveals a significant coefficient of correlation with safe space that follows by global integration value (r= 0.702, p &lt; 0.001), local integration value (r=0.648, p &lt; 0.001) respectively (see Table 1). Due to positive correlation among these variables, it can be concluded that accessibility measures directly proportionate to perceived safety by pedestrian in urban street spaces. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 164 | Mahdzar et al. Table 2. Correlation between accessibility measures and questionnaire results (Red point). Red point on the questionnary result R R square P-value Global integration value -0.699*** 0.489 0.0000 Local inegartion value -0.598*** 0.358 0.0003 Level of Connectivity -0.406* 0.165 0.0231 Choice value -0.322 0.103 0.070 *** = p&lt; 0.001, ** = p&lt; 0.010, * = p&lt; 0.050. Furthermore, the relationship between global integration value and fearsome space in the urba","The Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation known for its thrift store sale and scholarships for high school students, envisioned a preserve to instill an environmental consciousness in young people in the Ann Arbor area. It is to this effect we conducted a thorough ecological evaluation of the urban forest situated within the 17-acre property belonging to the Kiwanis Club, utilizing field monitoring, geographical information systems, and hydrological modeling. This included an on-site investigation of the KEEP, surveying species of amphibians, mammals, and birds inhabiting the area from early spring through late fall of 2019. A vegetation assessment identified plant species and habitats with an overview of land cover development from 1960 through 2005 using aerial photographs. The water quality of the two on-site ponds, wetlands, and Honey Creek included measures of pH, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, temperature, and metals. Additional analysis characterized benthic macroinvertebrates. Finally, hydrological modeling was conducted to characterize the potential rerouting of stormwater runoff into the two ponds to improve water quality. The findings of this comprehensive environmental assessment of the KEEP natural areas showed: 1) A multitude of habitat types allow for a wide range of wildlife and vegetation diversity, including amphibians, birds, mammals, grasses, shrubs, and trees. 2) Some terrestrial habitats have degraded due to an influx of invasive, nonnative species; while others have not and remain high quality. 3) The two ponds and wetlands are severely degraded in terms of physicochemical characteristics due to inadequate water renewal combined with large inputs of natural organic matter, e.g., leaves, algae, and duckweed. This prevents sustainable macroinvertebrate and fish communities. 4) Stormwater runoff from the KEEP building and parking lot are substantial during three seasons of the year and could be routed into the ponds to increase water flushing and renewal, thus improving water quality and allowing for the establishment of benthic and fish communities. Given the above four findings, the proximity of the property to urban and rural populations and schools, and the vision of KEEP leadership, there is tremendous potential for the creation of a unique and valuable educational resource. We recommend three primary site restoration actions: 1) Replant a subset of areas dominated with invasive plants using native species; 2) Route site runoff to one or two of the ponds to improve pond habitat. The pond habitat could also be improved by clearing outflow channels of excessive vegetation that impedes flow and creating a “fish wintering hole” near pond inflows; and 3) Provide improved drainage of the water-saturated forest area created in the past by installing and removing dirt berms. In addition to these restoration activities, future studies should establish a strategy for education kiosk(s) and boardwalks with educational signage. This could include a smartphone software interface with the KEEP database for visitors to learn about the biodiversity and habitats of the KEEP and how they interact in urban-rural areas. Our efforts build a strong foundation for the actualization of the KEEP.","Part 1 Ecological Systems Systems and Ecosystems The Concept of System Concept and Use of Models System State and Stability The Ecosystem as a System Mathematical Models of Ecosystems Organisms and Environmental Factors Categories of Organisms Chemical Composition of the Cell Metabolism-Enzymes Storage of Energy Photosynthesis-Respiration-Chemosynthesis Limiting Nutrient Interaction of Organisms and Environment Organisation at Population Level Population and Ecosystem Population Dynamics Population Size Variation Models Interactions between Two Populations Natural Selection and Evolution Survival Strategies of Populations The Human Population Organisation at the Ecosystem Level Energy Flow in the Ecosystem Limiting Factors in Various Environments Biogeochemical Cycles Ecosystems' Change in Time Functions of Aquatic Ecosystems Part 2 Fundamentals of Environmental Problems Values, Alterations and Degradation of the Natural Landscape Man's Historical Influence on the Biosphere Terrestrial Ecosystems Aquatic Environment Coastal Zones Biodiversity and Landscape The Environment in the City The Urban Environment The City and Urban Activities Cities in the Developing World Cities in Industrial Countries Noise Pollution Pollution from Urban Solid Waste Indoor Pollution Green and Open Spaces Toxic Pollution Toxic Pollutants, Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Toxic Synthetic Organic Compounds Toxic Pollution from Metals and Inorganic Substances Radioactivity Water Pollution Sources and Impacts of Water Pollution Organic Matter-Oxygen Depletion Phosphorus and Nitrogen-Eutrophication Pathogenic Microorganisms-Contamination Toxic Water Pollutants Oil Thermal Pollution Air Pollution and Global Change Sources and Local Implications of Air Pollutants Acid Rain Depletion of Stratospheric Ozone The Greenhouse Effect Part 3 Management of Environmental Problems Pollution Control Technology Dealing with Water Pollution Dealing with Atmospheric Pollution Urban Solid Waste Management Tools for Environmental Analysis, Evaluation and Management Environmental Management Definition and Assessment of Impacts on the Environment Environmental Indices and Indicators Life Cycle Analysis Environmental Audits Eco-Labels Environmental Certification Geographic Information System Environmental Impact Assessment Information Access and Participation in Decision Making Biodiversity and Landscape Protection Multiple Dimensions of Nature Protection Protection of Biodiversity and the Landscape as a Social Issue Methods of Biodiversity Conservation Environment and Development Impacts of Technology The 'Development versus Environment' Dilemma Sustainable Development Ecological Approaches of Development Future Prospects Selected Bibliography Appendix","In a context of global change, scientists and policy-makers require tools to address the issue of biodiversity loss. Population viability analysis (PVA) has been the main tool to deal with this problem. However, the tools developed during the 90s poorly integrate recent scientific advances in landscape genetics and dispersal. We developed a flexible and modular modelling platform for PVA that addresses many of the limitations of existing software. MetaConnect is an individual-based, process-based and PVA-oriented modelling platform which could be used as a research or a decision-making tool. Here, we present the core base modelling of MetaConnect. We demonstrate its potential use through a case study illustrating the platform’s capability for performing integrated PVA including extinction probability estimation, genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity analysis. We used MetaConnect to assess the impact of infrastructure works on the natterjack toad metapopulation functioning.","Forest ecosystem resilience is of considerable interest worldwide, particularly given the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and recent instances of zoonotic diseases linked to deforestation and forest loss. Novel, digital‐based technologies are also increasingly ubiquitous. We provide a more comprehensive understanding of how these new technologies are being used for forest management in different sectors and contexts, and discuss potential implications and future research needs for forestry researchers, managers, and policymakers. We carried out a literature database search and scoping review to collect peer‐reviewed articles from 2010 to 2020, and developed a forest‐technology classification to identify hardware and/or software technologies and techniques, methodology used, forest management application(s), spatial and temporal context, subsequent challenges and limitations, and opportunities. A qualitative analysis revealed a strong emphasis on remote sensing‐based innovations for forest monitoring, planning, and management, where machine‐learning techniques also play an important role in data collection, processing, and analysis. Data fusion approaches are also becoming more common, enabled by open‐source data sets and data sharing practices. More emerging technologies and applications include virtual/augmented environments for understanding human‐nature relationships and behavior patterns, automated workflows for forestry operations, and urban green infrastructure mapping and ecosystem services assessments via social media and mobile tracking applications. The continued adoption of digital‐based tools will likely bring about new research questions about forest ecosystems as dynamic social, ecological, and technological landscapes, and future work should more closely examine how forestry researchers, managers, and stakeholders can anticipate and adapt to both environmental and technological uncertainty change in a forest‐ecosystem context.","Glass manufacturing operations lead to an increasing number of abandoned slag heaps contaminated with metallic trace elements (MTE). However, the relative influence of edaphic factors on the biodiversity of glasswork wastelands is still poorly understood although closely related to sustainable land management practices. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to provide new insights into glasswork wastelands through the investigation of (i) Orthoptera, diurnal Lepidoptera, plant communities, and (ii) abiotic parameters in the topsoils. To that end, biodiversity indices were computed from ecological inventories performed on the herbaceous layer. In addition, soil samples were taken from the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) to assess agronomic properties, actually (CEC-exchangeable) and potentially bioavailable MTE fractions (DTPA-extractable) and pseudo-total MTE contents. On the one hand, the studied site was able to support a substantially higher than excepted biodiversity with orthopteran assemblages similar to grasslands and a diurnal Lepidoptera diversity comparable to urban parks. We also noted a positive influence of plant richness on the diurnal Lepidoptera community structure. On the other hand, topsoil analysis revealed a severe Pb contamination (1800-3100 mg kg-1) and a high potentially bioavailable Pb fraction (800-1300 mg kg-1). However, CEC-exchangeable MTE concentrations were all below the analytical quantification limits. Moreover, the site was characterized by a medium soil fertility. From these results, Pb contamination does not appear to be a primary limiting factor for the establishment of these communities. We assume that glasswork wasteland ecosytems are more affected by soil fertility or land management practices. To conclude, these sites are able to provide biodiversity ecosystem services, acting as wildlife sanctuaries for Orthoptera and diurnal Lepidoptera, and strategic metals by phytoextraction in a circular economy model. Thus, wasteland management practices should consider the local-scale drivers of biodiversity in order to reach at least the zero net loss of biodiversity.","A B ST R A C T Peri-urban cultivated areas of many cities in Pakistan are being irrigated from municipal and industrial wastewater since long. Similarly wastewater of Nullah Lai is also being used for irrigation in Rawalpindi. Wastewater and soil samples were collected from six locations of Rawalpindi districts for investigating fungal diversity. Eight fungal species were found in these soils. The most common fungal strains were Aspergillus sp., Acremonium sp., and Chaetomium sp. To isolate the fungi in different soil samples, sterilization technique, serial dilution and spread plate technique were used. Presence of fungi was detected in the different soil samples on the bases of morphological characteristics, percentage frequency, growth rate and colony forming units. The results obtained showed that most widely distributed fungi in soil samples were Aspergillus sp. Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus grew well in contaminated soil containing heavy metals. This ability of Aspergillus makes it attractive potential candidate for further investigation regarding its ability to remove metals from contaminated soil. The usage of untreated wastewater in agricultural land put harmful effects on soil physical, chemical properties and biodiversity. To recognize health risk due to wastewater usage for irrigation, treat the wastewater to the recommended level.","Introduction. Urbanization, intensification of road transport, development of urban infrastructure contributes to increased noise pollution. As traffic flows increase, so do acoustic discomfort zones, and the problem of traffic noise is becoming increasingly environmentally and socially important. Problem statement. The traffic flow significantly exacerbates the environmental problems of cities. One of the most negative factors is the increasing acoustic load. Noise pollution is currently becoming one of the most important environmental stressors. Noise levels depend on the intensity, speed, nature of traffic, type and quality of coverage, land use planning (longitudinal and transverse street profiles, building architecture, traffic lights) and the presence of greenery. Noise leads to an imbalance of auditory adaptation, regulatory processes of the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, hemodynamic disorders, the development of noise sickness. At long influence mechanisms of reflex and neurohumoral reactions are broken, there is a nervous pathology, attention decreases by 12-16%. Physiological and biochemical adaptation of a person to noise is impossible, in addition, noise has an inherent consuming effect. Acoustic load has a negative impact on flora and fauna. The main ones are reduced adaptive and reproductive capacity, changes in trophic nets, increased risk of predation, growth retardation, accelerated transpiration, death of leaves and flowers. This problem is most acute for urban ecosystems, as urbanization is one of the main factors in reducing biodiversity due to the loss of natural habitats, their fragmentation or drastic change. In urban conditions, many anthropogenic (industrial, transport noise) is added to the natural noise, which significantly changes the acoustic background. Currently, the noise load in megacities has increased by 12-15 dB, and the volume by three to four times. In cities with heavy traffic, the noise level is approaching 80 dB. Cartographic methods are widely used to visualize and predict noise load. Mapping the noise load of cities is relevant for Ukraine. Currently, acoustic maps have been developed only for certain districts of Kyiv. The creation of acoustic maps will help improve the ecological condition of urban areas. Purpose. Investigate and assess the level of noise load created by traffic flows on the main highways of the city of Khmelnytsky, create an acoustic map and determine the main directions of noise pollution. Research methods. general scientific (generalization, comparison, analysis and synthesis, theoretical and methodological substantiation); mathematical statistics; field (full-scale measurements of noise on the territory); cartographic (construction of a map-scheme) Results. The article highlights the problem of urban ecosystem acoustic load. It is evaluated the noise pollution of Khmelnytskyi city in Ukraine. The noise contamination model is constructed using GIS technologies within modern software package. It is shown that simulation and visualization of noise load using software makes it possible to objectively and detail estimate the acoustic situation and to propose managerial decisions development to protect the population from noise. Conclusion. The intensity of traffic noise depends on the condition and width of roads, the distance of residential buildings from the axis of the roadway. Depending on the capacity of roads, the presence of intersections changes the acoustic load. Reduction of urban traffic noise is associated with absorbing, reflecting, shielding and insulating acoustic ability. Optimization of noise protection of the urban ecosystem depends on a set of architectural and planning solutions. When introducing technical and economic characteristics of noise protection measures, it is necessary to take into account their features (practical limitations and opportunities).","Целью статьи явилось исследование сущности процессов метаболизма городов, анализ зависимости его факторов от уровня урбанизации на примере мегаполисов Казахстана и обоснование значимости учета метаболизмав управлении городскими системами.Для достижения цели проведен обзор теоретических взглядов на метаболизм городов, обоснована важность понимания сущности этого процесса, поскольку в нем отражается возрастающее воздействие урбанизации на окружающую среду. Рассмотрена эволюция концепций метаболизма городов, раскрыта трансформация его содержания. Исходя из обобщения сложившихся точек зрения на традиционную и расширенную модель городского метаболизма, предложено авторское видение этого понятия как сложного технико-экономического и экологического процесса накопления, хранения, потребления энергии, материальных ресурсов и производства отходов в результате функционирования городских систем и жизнедеятельности человека.Учитывая тенденцию повышения метаболизма городов, аргументирована необходимость количественной оценки и рационального управления этим процессом для повышения эффективности потребления ресурсов, снижения и максимальной переработки отходов производства и жизнедеятельности человека. Осуществлен анализ зависимости между процессом урбанизации и потреблением электро-, теплоэнергии, а также выбросов загрязняющих веществ в атмосферу городов Алматы и Нур-Султан. Сделан вывод о линейном характере зависимости между численностью населения и ресурсными потоками мегаполисов.Использованы методы логического анализа, аналогий и обобщений, экономической статистики, графического и корреляционного анализа.\n The growth of uncontrolled urbanization causes a number of problems related to the provision and consumption of necessary resources in the process of functioning of cities and their population. Urban systems are characterized by great complexity and in the process of socio-economic development closely interacts with the environment, the consequence of this is metabolism and its impact on the environment. The other side of the problem is the probability of a shortage of resources to meet the needs of urban systems, as well as their inefficient use. So, according to experts, by 2050, two thirds of the world's population may suffer due disadvantage of land and water, as well as disadvantage of food. Inefficient consumption of all types of resources leads to serious environmental consequences affecting humans and biodiversity. Therefore, an important problem that needs to be solved is the management of urbanization and the metabolism of cities in order to ensure the rational consumption of resources and waste recycling.The purpose of the article was to study the essence of the processes of urban metabolism, analyze the dependence of its factors on the level of urbanization on the example of megacities in Kazakhstan and substantiate the importance of accounting for metabolism in the management of urban systems.The methods of logical analysis, analogies and generalizations, economic statistics, graphical, correlation analysis are used.To achieve the goal, the evolution of the concept of urban metabolism is considered, the transformation of its content is revealed. The analysis of the relationship between the process of urbanization and the consumption of electricity, heat, as well as emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of the cities of Almaty and Nur-Sultan was carried out. It was made the conclusion about the linear nature of the relationship between the population and the resource flows of megacities.","The pollution of water bodies by nutrients and heavy metals can lead to a loss of biodiversity, environmental degradation, and harm to human health. During the two-month monitoring period (e.g., December 2019 to January 2020), variables such as trace metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, As, and Cr), nutrients (e.g., NH4+-N, TN, and TP), water temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were measured at 102 monitoring points in the main stream and tributaries of the Ganjiang River in the Poyang Lake Basin. A variety of multivariate statistical techniques, including cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation analysis, were used to conduct risk assessments and source analyses of the nutrient elements and heavy metals in the Ganjiang River system. The results show that although the Ganjiang River Basin is polluted by human activities, its water chemistry characteristics and trace metal and nutrient elements concentrations were better than the national standards. Through principal component analysis, the water pollution sources could be divided into urban sewage, agricultural activities, industrial activities, and the sources of industrial activities and transportation activities. The comprehensive risks of noncarcinogens (Hc) and comprehensive risks of carcinogens (Rc) for adults and children due to drinking water indicated that the risk from drinking water for the children in the basin was greater than that for adults, and that the Hc for adults and children was acceptable. However, the Rc for adults and children was slightly higher than the acceptable values. This study provides a reference for the fine control of the environmental water pollution sources in the Ganjiang river basin and health risk assessments in the basin, which are of great significance for improving the environmental water quality standards in the river basin and for reducing the risk of carcinogenesis.","Climate change in South Africa remains an issue of socio-economic and environmental concern. An increase in frequency and intensity of climatic events pose significant threats to biophysical and socio-economic aspects, namely food security, water resources, agriculture, biodiversity, tourism, and poverty. In order to counteract the socio-economic and environmental concerns pertaining to issues of climate change, emergent insights on climate change strategies suggest that building resilience in human and environmental systems is an ideal way of combating dynamic environmental conditions and future uncertainties. Using the qualitative secondary data approach, this article evaluates whether vulnerable communities in uMkhanyakude District Municipality can become resilient to the implications of climate change. UMkhanyakude District Municipality is predominantly rural and one of the most impoverished districts in KwaZulu-Natal, with the majority of socially and economically marginalised individuals and households experiencing more severe impacts as a result of climate change compared to those in urban areas. Data was analysed using content analysis and a concise summary of the biophysical and socio-economic aspects is presented. This research suggests that building resilience to climate change is possible when bottom-up, proactive and systematic measures are taken to manage vulnerable areas such as those in uMkhanyakude District Municipality. It recommends that social impact assessments (SIA) be conducted to assist in terms of assessing social consequences that are likely to follow from policy actions.","As a concept, the Anthropocene points to the change of scale in the relationship between human development and the Earth-System. Humanity has become a major geological agent, opening a new era in Earth's history, the outcome of which remains uncertain. As a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene is, paradoxically, mostly situated in the future, a subject for hard science-fiction. To prevent the irreversible and catastrophic consequences of a “hothouse earth” scenario, the epistemic community initially gathered around the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), rightly calls for a non-linear social transformation that can stabilize the Earth in a habitable state. This historical diagnosis echoes the pioneering insights provided by Vladimir Vernadsky in the 1920’s : the 21st century will be the time for humanity to finally unite and rise to the challenge of consciously regulating its cumulated systemic impacts on the biosphere. Or it will drive itself into “barbarization” and extinction. As serious doubts are cast upon the capacity of the westphalian international system to keep within the “safe operating space” of a governed Earth, the strategy suggested by the techno-scientific community is based on a cybernetic approach to “geopower”. Only a supranational technocratic stewardship of the Earth life-support system, insulated from democratic accountability and able to secure compliance from nation-states, could bring salvation to the human species. This post-political position is ideologically homogenous to ordoglobalism’s ambition to promulgate one law for the world economy. Is depoliticization the only realistic option for the survival of humankind? We argue that, by desperately clinging on an already obsolete holocenic technological enframing (Gestell) of the Earth, these conservative “meta-narratives” do not recognize the transformative and liberating cosmobiopolitical potential of the Anthropocene. Using a semiotic square to map the implications of the official discourse of the Anthropocene, we will show that different paradigmatic stories for the Great Transition can lead to creatively design actual politics of the Earth and respond to the The discourse of European imperialism as a textual practice that legitimates colonial domination of the environment, nonhumans, and non-European humans, is dependent on the discourse of speciesism. Taking a long view of the history of imperialist discourse, one can see that the figure of the human and the supplementary figure of the animal play complicated but relatively consistent roles in the language of oppression. Imperialist discourse can be embodied in either material or discursive practises that both advocate and ensure the exploitation of the wild animals and the opposition between the European colonizer and the animal, which has caused devastating consequences on the ecological harmony in the colonies. This paper examines Karen Tei Yamashita’s Through the Arc of the Rain Forest (1990) from an ecocritical perspective within the context of what Fredric Jameson identifies as the “cultural logic of late capitalism” 1 and Jason W. Moore formulates as the “Capitalocene.” 2 Yamashita brings together a cast of peculiar characters ranging from a three-armed American entrepreneur to a Brazilian feather guru and a Japanese immigrant with a small ball whirling around his head. This small ball is at the same time the narrative voice that tells the story which begins as a utopian capitalist tale in the Amazon basin but culminates in an apocalyptic epidemic and bacteria outbreak. Yamashita depicts the multi-layered operations of global corporate culture, and explores the intricate socioeconomic networks to reveal their detrimental effects on natural environment, humans, and non-human residents of the earth. Through the magic realist elements and combination of comedy, social satire, and apocalyptic tropes, Yamashita problematizes and reconfigures the binary logic defining the relationship between nature and culture, human and non-human, local and global, and real and imitation. This hybrid reconfiguration that permeates the subject matter of the story is also reflected unto its form which imitates a novela, a Brazilian soap opera, emphasizing the mediated nature of the text along with the mediatedness of nature in the text. It is in this sense, I argue, that Yamashita’s novel is an innovative response both to the environmental crisis within the material world and to the representational challenges in ecologically engaged narratives. With its open-ended structure, Through the Arc of the Rain Forest addresses, in Fredric Jameson’s words, “a fundamental antinomy of the postmodern” 3 and exemplifies Serpil Oppermann’s dialogical approach to “ecologically oriented postmodernism.” 4 It offers fertile grounds to consider the interconnection between socioeconomic networks, environmental realities, and discursive practices. This paper examines Sarah Hall's The Carhullan Army from a feminist ecocritical perspective , focusing specifically on the problems of population control, eco-disasters, and female subjugation. Taking place in a futuristic Britain devastated by an unspecified massive flooding event, the novel tells the story of Sister, a young woman who flees from the despotic regime of a government called the Authority to Carhullan, a farming-based, all female, commune. Through her story, the novel brings together very important issues relevant to both feminism and environmentalism, and opens a productive window for feminist ecocritical interpretations. On the one hand, it demonstrates how population control policies violently exploit women’s bodies and how women characters suffer from the mandatory use of coils done in the name of so-called environmental protection. On the other hand, once women get entangled in power relations, they themselves become as ruthless and domineering as men. Although Carhullan starts out with the ideal of creating an ecologically sustainable society devoid of coercion, it later dissolves into a dystopian and terrorist group, shattering its initial vision. It constructs another type of oppression where, this time, women become coercive just like men. I have chosen this novel as an exemplary case because it not only criticizes the androcentric mindset as the major cause of environmental destruction, but also problematizes power relations and draws attention to the reversal of power from men to women. In so doing, it encourages new feminist ecocritical interpretations and invites us to reflect on whether it is possible to end all types of oppression and establish ideal and peaceful societies. a sonic heritage of ecosystems by recording the biological sound of untouched forest ecosystems all around the planet. They produce unique soundscapes composed of ecosystem sound portraits for different biological regions of the Earth, with an aim to preserve the records of acoustic biodiversity. This paper presents a partly-autobiographical mythification, a narrative, a storied matter of risk and resilience of a poet-child’s survivalism by means of creative activities. It is about the epiphanies he arrives at while growing up and developing environmental consciousness, which will later lead him to the environmental humanities and the Anthropocene. While actually living earth-faced like any other organism often in harmony with nature via creative ekphrasis , the child plays kitkat in his Central Anatolian town, goes to a boarding school only to become yet another child, who writes poetry, short-stories, and even songs, takes photographs, makes animals out of tree-crusts. And best of all, he sings to and sometimes creatively mimics other species; he is like some other, and othered species making him the other, or maybe there is no other as he comes to realize later in life. Now, aged 65, as he is mothering two cats, this child wants to present this paper with samples of his creatively-cuthlu endeavours ( kutlu işler ) of camouflage and mimicry to prove his awakening to his own life-long path of ecological-consciousness, his attempts to believe that his kind must not be an endangered species when he is living as one with the rest of the beings in his environment, ie., ecesis. The paper is basically about the possibility of knowing one’s true-self via knowing and acknowledging other selves one is living with, the main idea being the belief in the transcendental oneness with the whole, as we are all parts of that whole, a belief, which is a remedy for othering, and an obstacle to the traps of antagonism, greed and hubris. One of the most effective forms of modernist resilience during the age of the Anthropocene shows itself through disrupting the traditional aesthetics of idealized natural beauty with a special treatment of anthropogenic effects on the natural and built environments as their post-war settings vividly exhibit. With their spatial focus on altered natural landscapes, modernist works keep a critical dialogue with the inherited ideals of the pastoral, reflecting an ironical attitude towards the generic aesthetics embedded in it. Their dark urbanatural atmosphere points to an immediate perception of (then) on-going radical anthropogenic changes on the ecological structure, predominantly caused by both World Wars on the landscape. Modernist aesthetics, rather than with a Romantic idealization of or return to the natural world, generates a complex configuration of ‘nature’ that questions the possibility of reaching any solid standards for defining the aesthetic ideals of ‘nature’ as it requires a clear distinction to be made between what is natural and what is urban in the first place. In this sense, this paper deploys dark environmental aesthetics, promulgated by Timothy Morton, Greg Garrard, and particularly Heather Sullivan as a critical frame to take stock of modernist forms of resilience in poetry engaging in an analysis of such landscapes as p","Solid waste management is one of the biggest concerns faced by the developing nations like India since phenomenon of urbanization has risen uncontrollably in recent years in these developing countries. This has led to develop and adopt new technologies for more constructive and efficient waste management system so as to reduce the pressure of solid waste management on the authorities as well as on environment. The initial step in the solid waste management is landfill site selection which is quite complex as it implicates many environmental factors. Suitability of the selected site is always accountable for loss or gain of the environment in the future and also it determines the economics and benefits or loss. Hence, it is always advisable that suitability should be determined considering economical and socio-environmental factors. This paper throws a light on the viability of new geospatial technologies like remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in the process of site selection for municipal solid waste in Calangute/Saligao, Goa, India. For the current study, Weighted Overlay Analysis is used to identify the suitability of the site. The research work identifies the arability of land for disposal of MSW in a systematic manner that ensures the environmental protection and management of waste products. This study provides the suitable dumping sites for municipal solid waste, which may be subjected to the green city management and city planning. Thus, this study provides an advance way to manage the solid waste of an urban area. This study expresses the efficiency of model-based technique that can help to deal with a burning issue like MSW across the globe. This model-based study can reduce laborious activities, minimize the cost of the project. Thus, it helps an urban planner to for better site selection for MSW management and overall city planning. This study will provide a base line for future study like leachate management, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, etc.","The purpose of this paper is to investigate all aspects of physical geography in planning the new capital in order to achieve an integrated tropical city. Many aspects are important in planning science because they are the basic aspects of implementing planning in an urban and regionally, especially in planning a new capital as will be done by the Indonesian government, namely moving the capital from Jakarta to Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara. Many studies related to this have been carried out by academics, agencies or research groups, but lack of discussing the planning of the new capital in the viewpoint of physical geography in a systematic, comprehensive and complete manner, even though this study is needed so that the new capital can include all aspects of the planning needed. The research method uses study literature from various sources and spatial analysis with approaches to all aspects of physical geography. Investigations from the new capital found biodiversity and abundant natural resources in terms of physical geography. The conclusion obtained from the study is that the physical geographical aspects of the new capital have advantages and can be used as large capital in the future by incorporating the principles of smart, green and sustainability towards the integrated tropical city.","Conflicts between the rights of private landowners and wider public interests are of central concern in urban planning. Increasing rates of urbanisation mean cities continually intrude into fringe rural land fostering expectations of windfall gains by some landowners and threatening the agricultural livelihoods of others. While such land use change is not new, increasing sustainability imperatives require consideration of biodiversity conservation, green space, bushland and the retention of sustainable rural operations within and around cities. However, strategic planning is often constrained by the strengths of the market and landowners' assumed rights and expectations. This paper examines such conflicts through a review of the relationship between property rights and social responsibilities. The role of neoliberalism in strengthening property rights and fostering land development is also explored. The paper analyses the case study of the policy reversal of a greenbelt proposal under Sydney's latest metropolitan strategy due to a landowner backlash in light of these considerations. The implications of the Sydney case are explored and a discussion of planning policy and process in an era of renewed focus on the market is presented. The need for a re-examination of property rights and responsibilities and strategic planning approaches becomes apparent if cities like Sydney are to move closer to a sustainable future. Introduction and Overview \"Never before has it been so evident that proprietary rights and proprietary duties are ultimately also social rights and social duties.\" (Gray, 2007, p. 26) The balance between private property rights and the public interest is one of the most fundamental roles and challenges of urban planning. The extent of private property rights in society evolves and changes over time and space and is arguably as strong as ever in Australia currently. This complicates the role of planning which is aiming to focus on the provision of sustainable cities against a background of more rapid urbanisation than at any time in history. The conflicts involved are starkly portrayed by policy reversals due to political pressure from individual landowners (in organised groups) seeking to maximise financial returns from private property rights over and above the interests of the wider community and future generations. This paper examines the dilemma raised by one such example - the withdrawal of proposed greenbelts around the two sectors earmarked for future urban growth in the latest Sydney metropolitan planning strategy, City of Cities. The research was conducted in order to explore the issues concerning one case study that provides an interesting example of some of the conflicts concerning private property rights and the wider public interest. An understanding of the issue requires an exploration of the relationship between private property rights, social rights and responsibilities, regulation and the role of the market. A brief review of literature concerning these conflicts is presented in the first section of the paper. Following this, the case of the proposed greenbelt and the aftermath of its demise is analysed through the examination of ecological reports, planning documents, submissions, media items and releases, and through interviews with departmental officers. The analysis highlights the conservation and environmental imperatives for the proposal and the lost planning opportunities in the face of development pressures and strong opposition from individual landowners. The role of planning in legitimising an expectation of windfall gains in the land market is also noted.","Tropical regions are known for their complex ecosystems and biodiversity, which play a vital role in regulating the global climate. However, researching tropical cities can be challenging due to the need for multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional approaches. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to gain a structured understanding of the developments and characteristics of tropical cities research in the last decade. We identified the fundamental influences in tropical cities research, based on four major sub-topics: climate change, sustainable urbanization, protecting biodiversity, and urban resource management. We examined the connections between these themes and performed a systematic literature review on each. Our analysis provides a comprehensive trend analysis of tropical cities, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings aim to provide a solid foundation for bridging the gaps for future crosscutting research.","The prospect of decline in biological diversity has become a central concern in the life sciences, both around the world and across the United States. Anthropogenic disturbance has been identified as a major factor affecting species diversity trends. An increase in the harvesting of naturally diverse timber stands in the South has become an important issue. The ultimate impact of this high, and increasing, level of disturbance on tree species diversity in forests of the Southern United States is uncertain. We offer a brief review of literature related to major points in the development of species diversity concepts over the last 100 years. This is followed by a case study that makes use of periodic U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from Mississippi. Our interest, for southern forests, is whether tree species richness has declined, increased, or remained essentially stable over the last 35 years. We find that tree species richness has declined by 11 percent across Mississippi since 1977. However, in FIA plots that had no evidence of harvesting, tree species richness increased by 44 percent since 1967. It is difficult to determine what constitutes a healthy level of tree species richness for particular sample designs and large-scale State surveys. Additional analytical complexity comes from the lack of documentation and knowledge concerning various levels of richness dynamics for large spatial and temporal scale studies. INTRODUCTION Questions about, concerns about, and interests in biological diversity have reached high levels of priority with academics, research scientists, resource conservationists, political decisionmakers, civic leaders, and interested members of the general public (particularly those in the environmental community). Though biological diversity has been of interest to ecologists for many decades, broader popular interest in the subject developed in the 1980s in response to the highly publicized exploitation and deforestation of tropical rain forests (Wilson and Peter 1988). This disturbance takes the form of intensive and extensive timber harvesting and land clearing. Heightened public interest in biological diversity and the decline of tropical forests was reflected in the 1986 National Forum on Biodiversity (Wilson and Peter 1988). Anthropogenic disturbance on forest land in the United States, and its long-term effects on forest biology, has also received considerable attention (Hunter 1999, Kimmins 1997, Kohm and Franklin 1997, Maser 1994, Noss and Cooperrider 1994, Perry 1994, Szaro and Johnston 1996). The types of disturbance range from permanent clearing, as in the conversion of forest land to urban or agricultural use (in this context permanent may mean only a few years to many decades), to intense and repeated harvesting activity. Increases in timber harvesting in the Southern United States has raised concerns about the longterm sustainable (both productive and ecologically sound) use of the forest resource. The concept of sustainable use is different from its predecessor, sustainable yield, in that equal weight is given to biological, social, economic, and political components, whereas sustainable yield matches levels and rates of harvesting with maximum rates of species production. See Campbell (2002) for more background on sustainability. 1 Research Forester, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Knoxville, TN 37919; and Professor, University of Tennessee, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Knoxville, TN 37996, respectively. So ut he rn F or es t Sc ie nc e: Pa st , P re se nt , a nd F ut ur e Bi od iv er si ty 336 Increases in timber harvesting on private land in the Southern United States have resulted primarily from a combination of consumer demands and reductions in the amount of publiclands timber being offered for contract sales. The latter follows from reductions in the allowable sale quantity [the amount of timber offered for sale on national forests by the USDA Forest Service (Forest Service)]. These reductions in timber being offered for sale can be attributed to issues related to habitat protection (as for the spotted owl in the Northwestern United States), reductions in budget and staff, and increases in the amount of time and money expended in litigation (Kohm and Franklin 1997). The result is that less timber is being removed from national forest lands, particularly in the West. The Southern United States is making up much of the shortfall in western timber production by increasing harvests on forest industry and nonindustrial private forest lands. Currently, the Southern United States accounts for 65 percent of all tree volume harvested in the United States (Smith and others 2001). This is a substantial increase since 1992, when the South contributed 55 percent of all harvested volume (Powell and others 1993). The issues of sustainable forests and sustainable forestry involve both shortand long-term impacts. An example of short-term impacts would be timber supply shortages while long-term impacts reflect the integrity of forest biology. The latter include, but are not limited to, soil deterioration, habitat destruction and alteration, changes in stand structure, successional interruptions, stand fragmentation, declines in old-growth area, age-class imbalance, changes in species composition, and impacts on overall biological diversity. Noss (1996) has identified seven types of biotic impoverishment in forests. These can be thought of as trajectories of change as the dynamics of natural forest processes are shifted by more intense management. The changes are: older stands to younger stands, structurally and compositionally complex stands to simple stands, large continuous forests to smaller fragmented patches, forest stands that are in close proximity to each other (or are continuous with) to increasingly isolated patches, frequent cool fires to fewer hot fires, few roads to many roads, and stable species populations to more endangered species. Any of these factors may occur independently or in combination. As forest harvesting activity in the Southern United States continues to increase, decisionmakers will need reliable information that tracks the impact of harvesting on forest resource integrity. In order to evaluate the long-term impact of intense timber harvesting, decisionmakers need to know how tree species diversity and overall forest composition may be affected. The effect an increasing area of artificially regenerated forest stands will have on species diversity over a large area, such as a State, is a related concern. For conservation strategies to be effective, reliable information about species diversity trends must be available. Traditional ecological studies have in most cases dealt with smaller areas. However, extrapolations from smallscale, independent, and scattered studies do not provide adequate and reliable information about conditions and processes over large spatial scales. The study of biological diversity is not new. This chapter presents a brief chronological review of the diversity concept as it has developed in the United States over the last century. We then discuss preliminary findings of a large-scale diversity assessment for an extensive forest area in the Southern United States, along with considerations that are important when applying such assessments over large geographic regions. A case study based on data from recent forest surveys of Mississippi is used to illustrate a method of tracking tree species richness over time. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE DIVERSITY CONCEPT IN THE UNITED STATES Much of the species diversity work after the 1950s was aimed at devising new mathematical methods for quantifying diversity assessments. This review does not cover the broad range of studies devoted exclusively to that subject. Additionally, a general lack of standardization in the terminology may cause some confusion. In this chapter, we use the terms richness and species diversity interchangeably, but we recognize that richness is one type of measurement attribute describing species diversity (Magurran 1988, Pielou 1974). Richness has traditionally been defined as the number of species occurring in a specific area. This area may be small or large. It is important to understand how the richness measure (or any other species diversity measure) is obtained because results obtained from applying different sample designs to the same sample population have differed considerably (Diserud and Aagaard 2002). Earlier, the concept of species diversity was regarded as a historical phenomenon related to the accumulation of species over time (Fischer","Biomimetic design process approaches have been emphasized systematically as a result of works among disciplines of current technology and biological science. In order to find solutions for a decrease in biodiversity, pollution, and issues of the ecosystem, the nature experience shows itself in areas of biomimetic products, architecture, and urban designs in which nature-focused invasions are basically being imitated. Nature-focused designs have set their own framework by examining forms of different nature dynamics (scale, function, formation process) by presenting a sustainable environment. It can be seen that designs are made real by adhering to the resolution of forms, understanding, and interpretation of nature and by embracing fractal designs with the effort of creating a sustainable environment. In this study, emphasis was placed on revealed nature-based design approaches. The article addresses biomimetic design processes, reveals the role of fractal parameters in the design process, and examines the use of biomimetic approaches. By drawing attention to the importance of studying and understanding these internal dynamics, the contribution of natural inspiration and fractal concepts to the design process is examined. We examine research related to the concept of biomimetics, creation/development of conceptual proposals, and analysis of the established theoretical proposal through selected urban design examples in order to determine the respective overlaps between these areas. Our study takes the form of an analysis of the formal organization of living things together with a formal analysis focusing on the design principles. We try to analyze the design principles and the changes in the principles, and discuss the resulting data within the framework of these concepts. The urban designs of Le Corbusier and Patrick Schumacher, who are important names of the 20th century, were examined in line with the findings obtained in terms of biomimesis levels, namely, the organism level, behavior level, ecosystem level, and functional level. Comparisons of urban design approaches are made using the meta-analysis method with respect to findings obtained as a result of an examination of the golden ratio, modular system, fractal, and parameter concepts of urban design. For this reason, when the fractal concept, which is one of the dynamics of biomimetic-oriented nature, is handled with biomimetic levels and its contribution to the design processes is investigated, we are able to determine that it has important parameters in terms of sustainability. This study aims to contribute to the field of industrial products and urban design disciplines in architectural design.","The similarities and differences in traditional, contemporary and global/international cultures’ development and use of institutions for the wise use of wetlands are explored across Western Australia. A process grounded in social anthropology is used to test a research hypothesis and to assess the structure and function of the diverse cultures’ institutions and empathy for wetlands. Six thematic case studies were located in catchments on Perth’s Ridge Hill, Perth’s Eastern Hills, Perth, and Western Australia’s Swan Coastal Plain, the Southwest, and its rangelands. Sources of evidence also include the literature on Aboriginal Australia, an extensive and detailed ethnographic review of regional and historic documents, the scientific literature of strategic water, wetlands and environmental management, and three decades of the author’s professional work. \nThis analysis demonstrates that traditional Western Australian cultures have diverse and effective institutions for sustainable use, conservation, protection and a well-developed empathy for their inland waters. In contrast, contemporary Western Australian cultures with some important exceptions do not, and are more accepting of the continuing exploitation and systematic destruction of the remaining natural waters, particularly in urban and agricultural areas of the Southwest. This recent destruction of wetlands is moderated occasionally by the efforts of traditional cultures, community and heritage organizations, sometimes through the use of contemporary planning and environmental protection institutions, and more rarely because of Australia’s obligations to global Conventions. The analysis explains why better use of these institutions is essential. Opportunities for improving wise use of wetlands in Western Australia are identified. \nParticularly important is the need for the more transparent engagement and regular reporting by the State of Western Australia in support of Australia’s obligations to the global Conventions. This includes reporting on progress towards the establishment of nature reserves on Swan Coastal Plain wetlands under Article 4 of the Ramsar Convention. It includes reporting the meeting of National targets for protecting priority biodiversity of inland water ecosystems, the protection of the buffers of wetlands and waterways as parts of ecological corridors, and State-wide progress towards use of traditional ecological knowledge to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Reporting is needed on progress made towards implementing relevant Articles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All reports might valuably include progress on identified new priority initiatives such as distributed network of wetland education centres, the better protection of monument wetland sites and improved indigenous heritage conservation. Such work, carried out in conjunction with Perth’s Whadjug peoples, the Southwest’s Nyoongar peoples, and the rangeland’s Kimberley, Yarnangu and Yamatji peoples, will help the conservation of the State’s inland waters as a necessary condition of human and ecosystem existence, as well as provide valuable common ground in which to practise tolerance, respect and cooperation between cultures. The better recognition of traditional ecological knowledge, the provision of more support for Indigenous engagement in wetland conservation, and the implementation of a far broader range of effective institutions are all identified as essential requirements for moving towards the wise use of wetlands in Western Australia.","Keynotes.- Ecological Informatics: Current Scope and Future Directions.- Semantically driven meta-modelling: automating model construction in an environmental decision support system for the assessment of ecosystem services flows.- Regular papers.- Governance of a Service-Oriented Architecture for Environmental and Public Security.- Integration of Environmental Management Information Systems and ERP systems using Integration Platforms.- State of the art and future research in Environmental Management Information Systems - a systematic literature review.- AKX - An Exchange for Predicting Water Dam Levels in Australia.- Environmental Engineering and Facility Management of Berlin's Public Buildings.- Spatial disaggregated emissions inventory for Cyprus.- A web-based information system rating regional projects by considering sustainable development.- Development of a Spatial Decision Support Framework for IMPETUS project in West Africa.- Development of a decision support system for the operation of thermal power plants in Western Macedonia.- Towards a Novel Early Warning Service for State Agencies: A Feasibility Study.- Application of Optimization Algorithms for the Improvement of Water Quality Monitoring Systems.- SQCB - Sustainability Quick Check Tool for Biofuels.- Volatile Organic Compounds measurements at schools in Kozani, Greece.- NoiseTube: Measuring and mapping noise pollution with mobile phones.- Monitoring of environment by energy efficient usage of Wireless Sensor Networks.- Plant Phenotyping with Low Cost Digital Cameras and Image Analytics.- Reproducing human decisions in reservoir management: the case of lake Lugano.- Predicting chemical parameters of the water from diatom abudance in lake Prespa and its tributaries.- Analysing chromatographic data using data mining to monitor petroleum content in water.- An Experimental Evaluation of ZCS-DM for the Prediction of Urban Air Quality.- An investigation of the effectiveness of advanced modeling tools on the forecasting of daily PM10 values in the Greater Athens Area.- Traffic Related PM Predictor for Besiktas, Turkey.- Development and Evaluation of Data Mining Models for Air Quality Prediction in Athens, Greece.- Artificial neural networks based modelling of carbon monoxide: Effects of spatial parameters.- Using Preprocessing Techniques in Air Quality forecasting with Artificial Neural Networks.- Approach for Dynamic Problems in Clustering.- Stakeholder Interaction in Sustainability Reporting with Web 2.0.- Meta-modelling for cross-sectoral land use policy impact analysis: A model requirements analysis of the SIAT.- An interdisciplinary approach to resolving conflict in the water domain.- Conceptual design and implementation of a model for the integrated simulation of large-scale land-use systems.- Enterprise systems applications development plans to build and develop robust and environmentally sensitive green logistics systems management software.- An investigation of the parameters influencing the determination of the number of particulate matter sources and their contribution to the air quality of an indoor residential environment.- Evaluating long-term contamination in soils amended with sewage sludge.- Evaluation by simulation of the social acceptability of agricultural policies for water quality.- COPERT: A European Road Transport Emission Inventory Model.- A Survey of Knowledge Organization Systems in Environmental Sciences.- Semantic modeling of temporal information in a database for biotope inventories.- Environmental notions representation and description: Towards a redefinition of the relationships between information systems development and individual cognition.- Multi-agent-based System Technologies in Environmental Issues.- Specimen's behavior management: A masterpiece for Biodiversity Information System's representation.- MACE - Multiagent Control for Energy Infrastructures.- Concluding talk.- Corporate Environmental Management Information Systems (CEMIS) for Sustainable Development.","The objective of this paper is to recommend planning options for improving the resilience, competitiveness, and sustainability of coastal cities. Insights for an improved understanding of dynamic coastal ecosystems and tourism impacts are shared. These are based on project level solutions and experiential knowledge of practices and a literature review of impacts of (a) growing pressures from coastal tourism in cities, (b) urban and environmental management practices, and (c) prevailing processes for creating and managing coastal infrastructure. Solutions to the identified problems are based on an analysis of the coastal ecosystems across three broad pillars: (i) city management, (ii) pollution and climate change risks, and (iii) coastal tourism. The problems range from a fragmented approach to coastal infrastructure planning; land and water pollution, fragmentation of natural ecosystems’ loss of habitat and unique biodiversity, salinity intrusion, and climate change risks from sea level rises and natural disasters; and tourism economy dependencies on the management of natural assets and cross-sectoral planning. The paper recommends paradigm shifts for innovative planning and policy approaches that engage communities, institutions, and other stakeholders.","Feasibility and sustainability of small-scale farming systems are the most critical factors that determine future investments of urban agro-farming while promoting eco-systematic livelihood development and biodiversity. The determination and the diversification of the ambivalent and heterogeneous factors that affect the investment decision making of small farming systems is studied in this work via the application of participatory modeling methodology of regional stakeholders. Defuzzification of the participants' categorical feedback is succeeded applying Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) to set the pairwise weight matrix of the determinants suggested by the stakeholders. At a second phase, an innovative Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) model is utilized to determine the weighted inter-causalities between all agricultural, environmental, and socio-economic criteria from the F-AHP output. Apart from the concept circumscription, we use the FCM to provide an in-depth scenario analysis including steady state and dynamic evaluation of driver concepts to receiver concepts in the model. The methodology is applied for the case study of heliciculture farming systems in Greece. Results show that sustainability is affected primarily by agricultural and inventory factors and secondarily by social and environmental factors identifying such cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment to be of low carbon footprint.","Abdullah, M.

Aerosols, including total suspended particles (TSP) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), were simultaneously collected in an urban forest park (Dafushan) at Guangzhou, southern China, from January 2012 to December 2013. The concentrations of 12 metals (Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) in both TSP and PM2.5 were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. The origins and possible sources of the studied metals in the PM2.5 and TSP were evaluated using the crustal enrichment factors and the principal component analysis, respectively. The results showed that Dafushan urban forest park was polluted by PM2.5 rather than by TSP. The PM2.5 and TSP in the forest park exhibited seasonal patterns with significantly higher contents in the dry season compared with the rainy season. The metals Al, Zn, Pb were the most abundant, while Hg was the lowest metals in the aerosols. The ratios of PM2.5/TSP ratio indicated that the metals were predominant in the finer particles (PM2.5). The crustal enrichment factors indicated that Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, Se and Zn in the aerosols originated from anthropogenic sources, while Al and Mn were mainly of crustal origin. The principal component analysis implied that industrial activities, traffic-related emissions, and soil dust were the main possible sources of the metals in both PM2.5 and TSP in Dafushan forest park."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>paperId<\/th>\n      <th>DOI<\/th>\n      <th>title<\/th>\n      <th>abstract<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"select":{"style":"os","items":"row"},"dom":"Blfrtip","rowId":0,"buttons":["selectRows","csv"],"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"responsive":true},"selection":{"mode":"none","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

natural habitat is replaced. However, there is momentum for implementing green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, wetland detention basins and community gardens, that partially offset these impacts and that benefit human health. GI is often designed to explicitly support ecosystem services, including implied benefits to biodiversity. The effects of GI on biodiversity have been rarely quantified, but research on this topic has increased exponentially in the last decade and a synthesis of the literature is needed. Here, we examined 1,883 published manuscripts and conducted a meta‐analysis on 33 studies that were relevant. We determined whether GI provides additional benefits to biodiversity over conventional infrastructure or natural counterparts. We also highlighted research gaps and identified opportunities to improve future applications. We determined that GI significantly improves biodiversity over conventional infrastructure equivalents, and that in some cases GI had comparable measures of biodiversity to natural counterparts. Many studies were omitted from these analyses because we found GI research has generally neglected conventional experimental design frameworks, including controls, replication or adequate sampling effort. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis identified that taxa specificity is an important consideration for green infrastructure (GI) design relative to the more common measurements at the community level. We also identified that ignoring multi‐trophic interactions and landscape‐level patterns can limit our understanding of GI effects on biodiversity. We recommend further examination of species‐specific differences among infrastructures (i.e. green, conventional or natural equivalents) or using functional traits to improve the efficacy of GI implementation on urban biodiversity. Furthermore, we encourage policy makers and practitioners to improve the design of GI to benefit urban ecosystems because of the potential benefits for both humans and global biodiversity.

               Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50&nbsp;ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.

of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km2 and 12,568,000 km2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km2 more likely.

               Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016–2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.

that offer a wide range of ecosystem services. In urban areas, wetlands contribute to the livability of cities through improving the water quality, carbon sequestration, providing habitats for wildlife species, reducing the effects of urban heat islands, and creating recreation opportunities. However, maintaining wetlands in urban areas faces many challenges, such as the reduction of hydrological functions, changed water regimes due to barriers, contamination by wastewater, habitat loss due to land-use change, and loss of biodiversity due to the entry of alien species. In this article, we review the theoretical background of wetlands in urban areas through the existing studies in the literature. We provide knowledge on urban wetlands and highlight the benefits of these wetlands in urban areas. These benefits include sustainability, biodiversity, urban heat islands, social perception, and recreation values. We also summarize the objectives, methodologies, and findings of the reviewed articles in five tables. In addition, we summarize the critical research gaps addressed in the reviewed articles. Our review study addresses the research gaps by performing a rigorous analysis to identify significant open research challenges, showing the path toward future research in the field. We further discuss and highlight the role of policymakers and stakeholders in preserving wetlands and finally present our conclusions.

natural areas into built environments, as well as by a series of impacts, such as loss of biodiversity, which interfere with the proper functioning of ecological networks.Design/methodology/approachThus, the authors apply a bibliometric analysis using the term “Urban Trees” in the “Web of Science” database, between 2009 and 2019, as a keyword to include all urban green structures and identify the main aspects of urban ecological relationships. They found 8,367 published articles.FindingsThis review identified the main countries and research institutions that operate in urban afforestation. In general, developing countries seek to understand the environmental benefits that urban afforestation can provide, demonstrating the importance of maintaining existing green areas in urban centers to promote the balance of the ecosystem. It depends directly on the flow of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructures in the city, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration, retention of particulate matter, mitigation of heat islands and reduction of surface runoff, directly favoring the health and well-being of the population. The authors conclude that the actions currently implemented in urban afforestation, especially to increase the richness and abundance of species, will be decisive for the future of urban centers and the construction of more sustainable and egalitarian cities.Originality/valueThis work sought to develop a bibliographic research based on information obtained by bibliometric analysis that has the ability to identify trends and volumes of scientific production in a given area of knowledge.

                                            There is an urgent need to thoroughly review and comprehend the effects of urbanization on wildlife in order to understand both the ecological implications of increasing urbanization and how to mitigate its threat to biodiversity globally. We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world.

                                                             The study of ecosystem services (ES) is becoming increasingly popular, as it plays an important role in human wellbeing, economic growth, and livelihoods. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the global trend in ES research using a rigorous systematic review of highly cited articles. The articles for this study were extracted from Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) covering the period from 2000 to 2020. This study was limited to SCI-E, ESCI, and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The term “ecosystem service/s” has been used as a research term to filter the study sample and eliminate other databases from the analysis. A citation level equal to or greater than 200 was used to further filtration of articles. This query could restrict to 128 articles that are highly cited in the selected period. Bibliometric analysis results show that, according to the author’s keywords, the “ecosystem service/s” keyword is highly connected to the “biodiversity”, “valuation”, “marine spatial planning”, and “conservation planning”. The U.S.A., Canada, China, France, and Australia are the leading countries in the cumulative number of highly cited articles and networks of co-authors. The U.S.A. is a strong contributor to ES research with China, Canada, and France. The most productive universities linked to the United States were the University of Minnesota, the University of California-Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara), and the Chinese Academy of Science. The most significant and compelling author is Halpern S Benjamin, who represents UC Santa Barbara. He has earned international recognition for a model he developed to analyze global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change in marine environments. The most accessed and studied fields in the ES are terrestrial, urban, and marine environments.

Numerous sampling methods are used, but a critical review of their relative effectiveness is lacking. Moreover, evidence suggests the relative effectiveness of sampling methods depends on habitat, yet efficacy in urban areas has yet to be evaluated. This study compared the bee community documented using observational records, targeted netting, mobile gardens, pan traps (blue and yellow), vane traps (blue and yellow), and trap-nests. The comparative surveys of native bees and honeybees were undertaken in an urbanized region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hot spot. The outcomes of the study were then compared to a synthesis based on a comprehensive literature review of studies where two or more bee sampling methods were conducted. Observational records far exceeded all other methods in terms of abundance of bees recorded, but were unable to distinguish finer taxonomic levels. Of methods that captured individuals, thereby permitting taxonomic identification, targeted sweep netting vastly outperformed the passive sampling methods, yielding a total of 1324 individuals, representing 131 taxonomic units—even when deployed over a shorter duration. The relative effectiveness of each method differed according to taxon. From the analysis of the literature, there was high variability in relative effectiveness of methods, but targeted sweep netting and blue vane traps tended to be most effective, in accordance with results from this study. However, results from the present study differed from most previous studies in the extremely low catch rates in pan traps. Species using trap-nests represented only a subset of all potential cavity-nesters, and their relative abundances in the trap-nests differed from those in the field. Mobile gardens were relatively ineffective at attracting bees. For urbanized habitat within this biodiversity hot spot, targeted sweep netting is indispensable for obtaining a comprehensive indication of native bee assemblages; passive sampling methods alone recorded only a small fraction of the native bee community. Overall, a combination of methods should be used for sampling bee communities, as each has their own biases, and certain taxa were well represented in some methods, but poorly represented in

                                                            The aim of this overview paper is to analyze the use of various landscape metrics and landscape indices for the characterization of landscape structure and various processes at both landscape and ecosystem level. We analyzed the appearance of the terms landscape metrics/indexes/indices in combination with seven main categories in the field of landscape ecology (1) use/selection and misuse of metrics, 2) biodiversity and habitat analysis; 3) water quality; 4) evaluation of the landscape pattern and its change; 5) urban landscape pattern, road network; 6) aesthetics of landscape; 7) management, planning and monitoring) in the titles, abstracts and/or key words of research papers published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals indexed by the Institute of Science Information (ISI) Web of Science (WoS) from 1994 to October 2008. Most of the landscape metrics and indices are used concerning biodiversity and habitat analysis, and also the evaluation of landscape pattern and its change (up to 25 articles per year). There are only a few articles on the relationships of landscape metrics/indices/indexes to social aspects and landscape perception.
11 During the last several decades, the quality of natural resources and their services have been exposed to significant degradation from increased urban populations combined with the sprawl of settlements, development of transportation networks and industrial activities (Dorsey, 2003; Pauleit et al., 2005). As a result of this environmental degradation, a sustainable framework for urban development is required to provide the resilience of natural resources and ecosystems. Sustainable urban development refers to the management of cities with adequate infrastructure to support the needs of its population for the present and future generations as well as maintain the sustainability of its ecosystems (UNEP/IETC, 2002; Yigitcanlar, 2010). One of the important strategic approaches for planning sustainable cities is „ecological planning‟. Ecological planning is a multi-dimensional concept that aims to preserve biodiversity richness and ecosystem productivity through the sustainable management of natural resources (Barnes et al., 2005). As stated by Baldwin (1985, p.4), ecological planning is the initiation and operation of activities to direct and control the acquisition, transformation, disruption and disposal of resources in a manner capable of sustaining human activities with a minimum disruption of ecosystem processes. Therefore, ecological planning is a powerful method for creating sustainable urban ecosystems.    In order to explore the city as an ecosystem and investigate the interaction between the urban ecosystem and human activities, a holistic urban ecosystem sustainability assessment approach is required. Urban ecosystem sustainability assessment serves as a tool that helps policy and decision-makers in improving their actions towards sustainable urban development. There are several methods used in urban ecosystem sustainability assessment among which sustainability indicators and composite indices are the most commonly used tools for assessing the progress towards sustainable land use and urban management. Currently, a variety of composite indices are available to measure the sustainability at the local, national and international levels. However, the main conclusion drawn from the literature review is that they are too broad to be applied to assess local and micro level sustainability and no benchmark value for most of the indicators exists due to limited data availability and non-comparable data across countries. Mayer (2008, p. 280) advocates that by stating "as different as the indices may seem, many of them incorporate the same underlying data because of the small number of available sustainability datasets". Mori and Christodoulou (2011) also argue that this relative evaluation and comparison brings along biased assessments, as data only exists for some entities, which also means excluding many nations from evaluation and comparison. Thus, there is a need for developing an accurate and comprehensive micro-level urban ecosystem sustainability assessment method. In order to develop such a model, it is practical to adopt an approach that uses a method to utilise indicators for collecting data, designate certain threshold values or ranges, perform a comparative sustainability assessment via indices at the micro-level, and aggregate these assessment findings to the local level. Hereby, through this approach and model, it is possible to produce sufficient and reliable data to enable comparison at the local level, and provide useful results to inform the local planning, conservation and development decision-making process to secure sustainable ecosystems and urban futures. To advance research in this area, this study investigated the environmental impacts of an existing urban context by using a composite index with an aim to identify the interaction between urban ecosystems and human activities in the context of environmental sustainability. In this respect, this study developed a new comprehensive urban ecosystem sustainability assessment tool entitled the „Micro-level Urban-ecosystem Sustainability IndeX‟ (MUSIX). The MUSIX model is an indicator-based indexing model that investigates the factors affecting urban sustainability in a local context. The model outputs provide local and micro-level sustainability reporting guidance to help policy-making concerning environmental issues.    A multi-method research approach, which is based on both quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, was employed in the construction of the MUSIX model. First, a qualitative research was conducted through an interpretive and critical literature review in developing a theoretical framework and indicator selection. Afterwards, a quantitative research was conducted through statistical and spatial analyses in data collection, processing and model application. The MUSIX model was tested in four pilot study sites selected from the Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia. The model results detected the sustainability performance of current urban settings referring to six main issues of urban development: (1) hydrology, (2) ecology, (3) pollution, (4) location, (5) design, and; (6) efficiency. For each category, a set of core indicators was assigned which are intended to: (1) benchmark the current situation, strengths and weaknesses, (2) evaluate the efficiency of implemented plans, and; (3) measure the progress towards sustainable development. While the indicator set of the model provided specific information about the environmental impacts in the area at the parcel scale, the composite index score provided general information about the sustainability of the area at the neighbourhood scale. Finally, in light of the model findings, integrated ecological planning strategies were developed to guide the preparation and assessment of development and local area plans in conjunction with the Gold Coast Planning Scheme, which establishes regulatory provisions to achieve ecological sustainability through the formulation of place codes, development codes, constraint codes and other assessment criteria that provide guidance for best practice development solutions. These relevant strategies can be summarised as follows:    • Establishing hydrological conservation through sustainable stormwater management in order to preserve the Earth’s water cycle and aquatic ecosystems;    • Providing ecological conservation through sustainable ecosystem management in order to protect biological diversity and maintain the integrity of natural ecosystems;    • Improving environmental quality through developing pollution prevention regulations and policies in order to promote high quality water resources, clean air and enhanced ecosystem health;    • Creating sustainable mobility and accessibility through designing better local services and walkable neighbourhoods in order to promote safe environments and healthy communities;    • Sustainable design of urban environment through climate responsive design in order to increase the efficient use of solar energy to provide thermal comfort, and;    • Use of renewable resources through creating efficient communities in order to provide long-term management of natural resources for the sustainability of future generations.

urban areas, but the effect on birds is unclear. To address this question, we compared bird species richness (BSR) and community composition between periurban (area surrounding the town) and urban (suburban and centre areas) landscapes across three spatial scales.    2  At a large biogeographical scale (temperate and boreal climatic zone), relationships between the BSR of urban areas and their surrounding landscapes were examined in a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. In general, BSR was negatively correlated with latitude and urbanization. The BSR of suburban and centre landscapes correlated positively with the BSR of periurban landscapes. However, latitudinal effects were also involved, as BSR in urban and periurban landscapes declined as town latitude increased. Similarity indices were low (50%) between periurban and centre bird communities.    3  At a regional scale, we assessed winter bird data from several towns within three regions of temperate and boreal countries (western France, northern Finland and eastern Canada). The type of periurban landscape, number of inhabitants and town diameter did not affect BSR. BSR was similar between the cities of a given biogeographical area. Bird communities were more similar between similar habitat types of different cities than between different habitats of the same city.    4  At a local scale, we tested the influence of proximity to the periurban landscape on BSR in parks of western French towns of different size. Neither BSR nor community similarity changed in relation to the distance of the park from the periurban landscape.    5  Guild composition according to diet and feeding habitat did not vary between urban and periurban locations at regional or local scales.    6  We conclude that, at regional and local scales, urban bird communities are independent of the bird diversity of adjacent landscapes, and that local features are more important than surrounding landscapes in determining BSR. Whatever the biodiversity quality of the periurban landscape, site-specific actions such as shrub and tree planting, water restoration and increasing vegetation diversity can change bird diversity in towns and improve the quality of human–wildlife contacts.</code></pre>
